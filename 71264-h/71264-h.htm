INTRODUCTION
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There have been many attempts to explain
the revolution which took place in Ireland
during Easter Week, 1916.  And all of them give
different reasons.  Some have it that it was
caused by the resentment that grew out of the
Dublin Strike of 1912-13; others, that it was
the threatened Ulster rebellion, and there are
many other equally wrong explanations.  All
these writers ignore the main fact that the
Revolution was caused by the English
occupation of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
So many people not conversant with Irish
affairs ask: Why a revolution?  Why was it
necessary to appeal to arms?  Why was it
necessary to risk death and imprisonment for the
self-government of Ireland?  They say that
there was already in existence an Act for the
Self-government of Ireland, that it had been
passed through the English House of Commons,
and that if we had waited till the end of
the war we would have been given an opportunity
to govern ourselves.  That they are not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pviii"></a>viii}</span>
conversant with Irish affairs must be their
excuse for thinking in that manner of our
struggle for freedom.
</p>

<p>
To be able to think and to speak thus one
must first recognize the right of the English to
govern Ireland, for only by so doing can we
logically accept any measure of self-government
from England.
</p>

<p>
And we cannot do so, for, as a nation Ireland
has never recognized England as her conqueror,
but as her antagonist, as an enemy
that must be fought.  And this attitude has
succeeded in keeping the soul of Ireland alive
and free.
</p>

<p>
For the conquest of a nation is never complete
till its soul submits, and the submission
of the soul of a nation to the conqueror makes
its slavery and subjection more sure.  But the
soul of Ireland has never submitted.  And
sometimes when the struggle seemed hopeless,
and sacrifice useless, and there was thought to
make truce with the foe, the voice of the soul
of Ireland spoke and urged the nation once
more to resist.  And the voice of the soul of
Ireland has the clangor of battle.
</p>

<p>
There have been many attempts to drown
the voice of the soul of Ireland ever since the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pix"></a>ix}</span>
coming of the English into our country.  There
have been some who have had the God-given
gift of leadership, but still sought to misinterpret
the sound of the voice; who in shutting
their ears to the call for battle have helped to
fasten the shackles of slavery more securely
on their country.
</p>

<p>
There was Daniel O'Connell who possessed
the divine gift of leadership and oratory, and
in whose tones the people recognized the voice
of Ireland and flocked around him.  During
the agitation for the Repeal of the union
between Ireland and England the people
followed O'Connell and waited for him to give
the word.  Never for one moment did they
believe that the movement was merely a
constitutional one.  Sensibly enough they knew that
speeches, meetings and cheers would never
win for them the freedom of their country.
They knew that force alone would compel
England to forego her hold upon any of her
possessions.
</p>

<p>
So that when in 1844 O'Connell sent out the
call bidding all the people of Ireland to muster
at Clontarf, outside Dublin, they believed that
the day had come, and from North, South, East
and West they started on the journey.  Those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Px"></a>x}</span>
who lived in the West and South traveled the
distance in all sorts of conveyances, many of
them, especially the poorer ones, walked the
distance; but the trouble, the weariness, the
hardship were all ignored by them in the
knowledge that they were once more mustering to do
battle for the freedom of their country.
</p>

<p>
But in the meantime, while the people were
making all speed to obey the summons of
O'Connell, the meeting had been proclaimed
by the British Government; and the place of
muster was lined with regiments of soldiers
with artillery with orders to mow down the
people if they attempted to approach the
meeting place.  Then it was that O'Connell failed
the people of Ireland, and rung the knell for
the belief of the Irish people in constitutionalism.
He said, "All the freedom in the world
is not worth one drop of human blood," and
commanded the people to obey the order of the
British Government and to return to their
homes.
</p>

<p>
There are many pitiful, heart-breaking
stories told of the manner in which this command
of O'Connell reached the people.  Many who
had walked miles upon miles reached the
outskirts of Dublin only to meet the people
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxi"></a>xi}</span>
pouring out of it.  When in return to their
questions they were told that it was the request of
O'Connell that they return to their homes, the
heart within them broke for they knew that
their idol had failed them, and their hopes of
freeing Ireland were shattered.
</p>

<p>
Within the Repeal Association there was
another organization called the Young
Irelanders, which published a paper called <i>The
Nation</i>.  This paper was an immense factor in
arousing and keeping alive a firm nationalist
opinion in Ireland.  The Young Irelanders
were revolutionists, and by their writings
counseled the people to adopt military uniforms, to
study military tactics, to march to and from
the meetings in military order.  They made no
secret of their belief that the freedom of
Ireland must be won by force of arms.
</p>

<p>
During the famine in 1847, when the people
were dying by the hundreds, although there
was enough food to feed them, the Young
Irelanders worked untiringly to save the people.
At that time potatoes were the staple food of
the people, everything else they raised, corn,
pigs, cattle, etc., had to be sold to pay the
terrible rackrents.  The Young Irelanders called
upon the people to keep the food in the country
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
and save themselves; but day by day more food
was shipped from the starving country to
England; there to be turned into money to pay the
grasping landlords.  It was during this time
that John Mitchell was arrested and transported
for life to Van Diemen's land.
</p>

<p>
In 1848 there was an ill-fated attempt at
insurrection.  Even in the midst of famine and
death, with the people dying daily by the roadside,
there was still the belief that only by an
appeal to force and arms could anything be
wrung from England.  In Tipperary, under
Smith O'Brien, the attempt was made, more as
a protest then, for famine, death, and misery
had thinned the ranks, than with any hopes of
winning anything.  Most of the leaders were
soon arrested and four of them were sentenced
to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; but this
sentence was afterwards commuted to life
imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
For many years after the famine the people
were quiescent, and had grown quite
uncaring about Parliamentary representation.
And then was formed a revolutionary secret
society calling itself the Fenians.  The members
of this organization were pledged to work
for, and, when the time came, to fight for and
}xiii}
establish, an Irish Republic.  James Stephens
was the chief organizer.  The organization
spread through Ireland like wildfire.  Even the
English Army and Navy were honeycombed
with it.  Every means possible were taken by
the English to cope with this new revolutionary
movement&mdash;but they failed.  The organization
decided that a Rising would take place in
February, 1867.  This was later postponed; but
unfortunately the word did not reach the South
in time and Kerry rose.  The word spread over
Ireland that Kerry was up in arms.  Measures
were taken by the English to meet the insurrectionists,
but before they reached the South the
men had learned that the date of the rising
had been postponed and had returned to their
homes.  Luby, O'Leary, Kickham, and
O'Donovan Rossa were arrested.  Still the Rising
took place on the appointed date, although
doomed to failure owing to the crippling of
the organization by the arrest of its leaders,
and the lack of arms.  Even the elements were
against the revolutionists, for a snowstorm,
heavier than any of the oldest could remember
having seen, fell and covered the country
in great drifts.
</p>

<p>
They failed.  But the teaching of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxiv"></a>xiv}</span>
Fenians and the organization they founded are
alive to-day.  It was the members of this
organization that first started the Irish
Volunteers.  Ever on the watch for a ripe moment
to come out and work openly, ever longing for
the day when military instruction could be
given to the nationalist youth, they seized upon
the fact that if the Ulster Volunteers were
permitted to drill and arm themselves to fight the
English Government so could they.  And in
November, 1913, they called a meeting in the
Rotunda, Dublin, and invited the men and
women of Ireland to join the Irish Volunteers,
and pledge themselves "to maintain and secure
the rights and liberties common to all the
people of Ireland."
</p>

<p>
So once more the people of Ireland heard the
call to arms, and right royally they answered
it.  The Irish Volunteer Organization spread
throughout the land, and the youth of Ireland
were being trained in the art of soldiering.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that, like Daniel O'Connell and
other constitutional leaders, Redmond proved
himself of the body and not the soul of Ireland.
He did not follow the example of Parnell,
whose follower he was supposed to be, and use
the threat of this large physical force party to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxv"></a>xv}</span>
gain his ends from the English Government.
Parnell used to say to the British House of
Commons: "If you do not listen to me, there
is a large band of physical force men, with
whom I have no influence, and upon whom I
have no control, and <i>they</i> will compel you to
listen to them."  But Redmond, jealous of all
parties outside his own (knowing well that
when an Irishman had a rifle in his hands he no
longer felt subservient to, or feared England;
and that when the people of Ireland had the
means to demand the freedom of their country
they grew impatient of speech-making and
petitioning), grew fearful for the loss of power
of the Irish Parliamentary Party.
</p>

<p>
He knew also, that, as in the days of
O'Connell, Butt, and Parnell, the people firmly
believed that all the talk and show of
constitutionalism was a blind, merely a throwing of
dust in the eyes of the English Government,
and to save himself and his Party he must
approve this physical Force party.  But not
content with approval he needs must try to
capture the Irish Volunteers.  This attempt, I
firmly believe, was made upon the advice, or
the command of the British Government.  He
sent a demand to the Executive Committee
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvi"></a>xvi}</span>
that a number of his appointees be received
upon the Committee.  This would enable him
to know and obstruct all measures made by
the Irish Volunteers and would prevent the
loss of power of the Parliamentary Party.
</p>

<p>
By the votes of a small majority of the
Committee these appointees were accepted.
But the Committee soon found out that it was
impossible to arm and prepare men for a
revolution against a government, while the paid
servants of that government were amongst
them.  They decided to part company even
at the risk of a division in the ranks.  They
knew that every man who remained with them
could be depended upon to do his part when
the time for the Rising came.
</p>

<p>
Then England went to war.  Shortly
before this a Home Rule Bill had passed two
readings in the House of Commons.  England
saw the stupidity of appealing to Irishmen
to go to fight for the freedom of small
nationalities, while any measure of freedom
was denied to their own.  So the Home Rule
Bill passed the final reading in the House of
Commons, and was put upon the Statute
Book.  Then fearful of the dissatisfaction of
the Unionists an amendment was tacked on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvii"></a>xvii}</span>
that prevented its going into effect until after
the war.
</p>

<p>
John Redmond dealt the final blow to his
influence upon Ireland when he began to
recruit for the English Army.  Many of his
followers, taking his word that Home Rule
was now a fact entered the English Army at
his request.  They were, in the main, young,
foolish, and ignorant fellows unable to
analyze the Bill for themselves, and therefore
could not know that the so-called Home Rule
was a farce.  They did not know that the Bill
gave them no power over the revenue, over
the Post Office, over the Royal Irish
Constabulary, that they could not raise an army,
or impose a tax, and that no law passed by
the Irish Parliament could go into effect until
the English House of Commons had given its
approval.  It was like telling a prisoner that
he was free and keeping him in durance.
</p>

<p>
And from the beginning of the war the Irish
Volunteers spent all the time they could in
intensive drilling, not knowing at what time
their hand might be forced, or the opportune
moment for the Rising might arrive.
</p>

<p>
For in Ireland we have the unbroken tradition
of struggle for our freedom.  Every
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxviii"></a>xviii}</span>
generation has seen blood spilt, and sacrifice
cheerfully made that the tradition might live.
</p>

<p>
Our songs call us to battle, or mourn the lost
struggle; our stories are of glorious victory
and glorious defeat.  And it is through them
the tradition has been handed down till an
Irish man or woman has no greater dream of
glory than that of dying

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
My first mingling with an actively, openly
drilling revolutionary body took place during
the Dublin strike of 1912-1913.  I was living
in Belfast then and had come to Dublin to see
how things were managed, how the food was
being distributed and the kitchens run; and, in
fact, to feel the spirit of the people.
</p>

<p>
James Connolly, my father, was at that time
in Dublin assisting James Larkin to direct the
strike.  He was my pilot.  Liberty Hall, the
headquarters of the Irish Transport and
General Workers Union, the members of which
were on strike, was first visited.  It is situated
on Beresford Place facing the Custom House
and the River Liffey.  In the early part of
the nineteenth century it had been a Chop
House.  Almost from the big front door a
wide staircase starts.  It ends at the second
story.  From there it branches out into
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
innumerable corridors thickly studded with doors.
It took me a long time to master those corridors.
Always I seemed to be finding new
ones.  Downstairs on the first floor were the
theater and billiard rooms; and below them
were the kitchens.  During the strike these
kitchens were used to prepare food for the
strikers.  It was to the kitchens my father first
piloted me.
</p>

<p>
Here the Countess de Markieviez reigned
supreme&mdash;all meals were prepared under her
direction.  There were big tubs on the floor;
around each were about half a dozen girls
peeling potatoes and other vegetables.  There
were more girls at tables cutting up meat.  The
Countess kept up a steady march around the
boilers as she supervised the cooking.  She
took me to another kitchen where more delicate
food was being prepared for nursing and
expectant mothers.
</p>

<p>
"We used to give the food out at first," she
said.  "But in almost every case we found that
it had been divided amongst the family.  Now
we have the women come here to eat.  We are
sure then that they are getting something
sufficiently nourishing to keep up their strength."  She
showed me a hall with a long table in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
center and chairs around it.  As it was near
the "Mothers' dinner hour," as the girls called
it, some of the striking women and girls were
there to act as waitresses.
</p>

<p>
We came to the clothing shop next.  Some
persons had caught the idea of sending warm
clothing for the wives and children of the
strikers; accordingly one of the rooms of
Liberty Hall was turned into an alteration room.
Several women and girls were working from
morning to night altering the clothes to fit the
applicants.  One of the girls said to me, "It
was a wonder to us at first the number of
strikers who had extra large families, until we
found out that in many cases their wives had
adopted a youngster or two for the day, and
brought them along to get clothed."  Not
strictly honest, perhaps, but how human to
wish to share their little bit of good fortune
with those not so fortunate as themselves.
How many little boys and girls knew for the
first time in their lives the feel of warm
stockings and shoes, and how many little girls had
the delicious thrill of getting a new dress fitted
on.
</p>

<p>
Thence to Croyden Park.  Some time before
the strike this immensely big place had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
been taken over by the Union.  I do not know
how large it was but there were fields and fields,
and long pathways edged with trees.  It was
used by the members as a football ground and
for hurley and all sorts of sports and games.
But this time the fields were ringed round with
men and women watching the rows and rows of
strikers who were in the fields, marching now
to the right, now to the left at the commands of
Captain White, who stood in the center, a tall
soldierly figure blowing a whistle and gesticulating
with great fervor.
</p>

<p>
Back and forth, right and left they marched
with never a moment's rest; then round and
round the fields they ran at the double; the
Captain now at the head, now at the rear, now
in the center shouting commands incessantly,
sparing himself no more than the men.  I
remember once he stopped beside my father and
myself; he was in a terrible rage, his hands
were clenched and he was fairly gnashing his
teeth.  He had given a signal to one of the
columns and they had misinterpreted it.
</p>

<p>
"Easy now, Captain," said my father, "remember
they are only volunteers."  Captain
White turned like a flash.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "And aren't they great?"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
And he forgot his rage in his admiration of the
men of a few weeks' training.  He gave an
order, the men marched past and at a given place
they received broom handles with which they
practiced rifle drill.
</p>

<p>
After rifle drill came the line up for the
march home.  We waited till the last row was
filing past and then fell in and marched back
to the city with the Irish Citizen Army.  It
was exhilarating.  At no period could I see
the first part of the Army.  The men and boys
were whistling tunes to serve them in lieu of
bands.  On they swung to Beresford Place,
where they lined up in front of Liberty Hall.
Jim Larkin and my father spoke to them from
the windows.  When one man called out,
"We'll stick by you to the end," he was loudly
and heartily cheered.  Captain White gave
the order of dismissal and the men broke ranks
but did not go away.  When they were not
drilling, or sleeping, or eating, they thronged
round Liberty Hall, attesting that "where
the heart lieth there turneth the feet."
</p>

<p>
When the strike was over and the men had
won the right to organize, the membership of
the Irish Citizen Army dwindled rapidly.
When one takes into consideration the arduous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
work and the long hours that comprised the
daily round of these men, the wonder was that
there were so many of them willing to meet
after working hours to be drilled into perfect
soldiers.  But they knew that by so doing they
were, in the words of my father, "signifying
their adhesion to the principle that the freedom
of a people must in the last analysis rest in the
hands of that people&mdash;that there is no outside
force capable of enforcing slavery upon a people
really resolved to be free, and valuing freedom
more than life."  Also that "The Irish
Citizen Army in its constitution pledges its
members to fight for a Republican Freedom
in Ireland.  Its members are, therefore, of the
number who believe that at the call of duty
they may have to lay down their lives for
Ireland, and have so trained themselves that at
the worst the laying down of their lives shall
constitute the starting point of another glorious
tradition&mdash;a tradition that will keep alive
the soul of the nation."  And this was the
knowledge that lightened all the labor of
drilling and soldiering.
</p>

<p>
I was present at a lecture given to them by
their Commandant, James Connolly.  It was
on the art of street fighting.  I remember the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
close attention every man paid to the lecture
and the interest they displayed in the diagrams
drawn on the board the better to explain his
meaning.  At the close of the lecture he asked,
"Are there any questions?" There were many
questions, all of them to the effect, whether it
would not be better to do it this way, or could
we not get better results that way.  All in
deadly earnestness, thinking only on how the
best results might be achieved and not one man
commenting on the danger to life the acts
would surely entail.  That one would have to
risk death was taken for granted.  Their one
thought was how to get the most work done
before death came.
</p>

<p>
A few months later there were maneuvers
between one company of the Irish Citizen
Army and a company of the Irish Volunteers.
The Irish Volunteers had been formed after
the Irish Citizen Army and by this time had
spread over the length and breadth of Ireland.
While the Irish Citizen Army admitted none
but union men the Irish Volunteers made no
such distinction.  And as they both had the
one ideal of a Republican Ireland there was
much friendly rivalry between the two bodies.
This time the maneuvers took the form of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
sham battle, which took place at Ticknock
about six miles outside of Dublin.  The Irish
Citizen Army won the day.  I particularly
remember that afternoon.  My father came into
the house, tired but pleasantly excited&mdash;he had
been an onlooker at the sham battle.  "I've
discovered a great military man," he said in
high glee.  "The way he handled his men
positively amounted to genius.  Do you know
him&mdash;his name is Mallin?"
</p>

<p>
I did not know him then.  I met him later
when he was my father's Chief of Staff.
During the rising he was Commandant in charge
of the St. Stephen's Green Division of the
Army of the Irish Republic, and he was
executed during that dreadful time following the
surrender of the Irish Republican Army.

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
During the month of July, 1914, I was
camping out on the Dublin mountains.  The
annual convention of Na Fianna Eireann
(Irish National Boy Scouts) had just been
held, and I was a delegate to it from the
Belfast Girls' Branch, of which I was the
president.  On the Sunday following the
convention we were still camping out; but were
suffering all the discomforts of blowy, rainy,
stormy weather.  Madame (the Countess
de Markievicz) had a cottage beside the
field where we were encamped, and it was
thronged with us all that Sunday.  Nothing
would tempt us out in the field that night,
and we kept putting off the retiring time, hour
by hour, till it was nearly twelve o'clock.  At
that time we had just taken our courage in
both hands, and were forcing ourselves to go
out to our tents.  We were standing near the
door with our bedding in our arms when some
of the Fianna boys halloed from outside.  We
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
gladly opened the door&mdash;another excuse for
putting off the evil moment&mdash;and about half a
dozen boys came in to the cottage.  They were
in great spirits, although they had tramped
some miles in the rain, and exhibited strange
looking clubs to our curious eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Guess what we've been doing to-day, Madame,"
they said, but with an expression on
their faces which said, "you'll never guess."
</p>

<p>
"It's too much trouble to guess," said Madame.
"Tell us what it was and we will know
all the quicker."
</p>

<p>
"We've been helping to run in three thousand rifles."
</p>

<p>
"Rifles&mdash;where&mdash;quick&mdash;tell me all about it.  Quick."
</p>

<p>
"At Howth.  But did you hear nothing about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  Tell me quick."
</p>

<p>
"Did you not hear that we had a brush with
the soldiers; and that some were shot and some
were killed?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no.  Begin at the beginning and tell
us the whole story."
</p>

<p>
"Well, during the week we were told to report
at a certain place to-day&mdash;that there was
important work to be done.  This morning we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
met as we were told, and we were shown these
clubs.  They were to be all the arms we were
to have.  We started out to march with the
Volunteers to Howth.  We knew, somehow or
other, that we were going to get rifles but none
of us knew for a fact how we were going to
get them.  As we marched we made all sorts
of guesses as to how the rifles were coming.
Of course, we did not carry the clubs in our
hands; we brought them with us in the trek
cart.  But for a few others we were the only
ones who knew what was in the cart.  And
do you know, Madame," he said with a veteran's
pride, "we marched better than the Volunteers."
</p>

<p>
"When we came near Howth," said another
boy as he took up the story, "two chaps came
running towards us and told us to come on at
the double.  The Volunteers were rather tired
but when they heard the word 'rifles' they
simply raced.  When we arrived at the harbor
we saw the rifles being unloaded from a yacht.
You ought to have heard the cheers when we
saw them!  Then it was that the clubs were
distributed.  They were given to a picked body
of men and they were formed across the entrance
to the pier.  They were to use the clubs
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
if the police attempted to interfere with them.
The rifles were handed out to the men, but
there were more rifles than men so some had to
be sent into the city in automobiles.  Most of
the ammunition was sent into the city in
automobiles but quite a lot was put into the trek
cart.  But none was served out to the men."
</p>

<p>
"That was a nice thing to do," said the first
boy, "to give rifles and no ammunition.  And
when we were attacked we couldn't shoot back.
We had a fight with the soldiers and the police
near the city.  And when the soldiers and the
police attacked us and might have taken the
trek cart from us, we had only the butts of our
rifles to defend it with.  But we beat them off.
Later on, though, they took their revenge when
they shot down defenseless women and children.
They just knelt down in the middle of
Bachelor's Walk and fired into the crowd.  I
don't know how many were killed&mdash;some say
five, some say more."
</p>

<p>
"But you brought the rifles safe," said Madame.
</p>

<p>
"The whole city is excited.  The people are
walking up and down the streets, they don't
seem to think that they have any homes to go to."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-012"></a>

</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
</p>

<p>
When we heard that we wanted to dress and
go down to Dublin.  We wanted a share of the
excitement, if we had not had any share in the
fight.  But Madame vetoed that suggestion
almost as soon as it was mooted.  We had to
go to bed.  But we had so much to talk about
that we scarcely noticed the sogging wet tent
when we were inside.
</p>

<p>
The next morning was gloriously fine.  We
breakfasted and were making plans to go into
the city to hear some more about yesterday's
exploit.  Madame had already cycled in, and
we were left to our own devices.  We had not
quite finished our work around the camp when
we saw a taxi-cab stopping near the gate that
was used as an entrance to the field.  As we
ran towards it we wondered what had brought
it there.  Before we reached it, however, one
of the Fianna captains had jumped out of the
taxi and was coming towards us.
</p>

<p>
"I have about twenty rifles in the car, and I
want to get them to Madame's cottage," he
said.  "Will you help?"
</p>

<p>
We were glad of the opportunity.  We
jumped over the hedge into the next field where
there were no houses, and had the rifles handed
to us.  We could only carry two at a time.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
captain stood at the car on the lookout, and
also handed the rifles to us.  We carried the
rifles down to the window back of Madame's
cottage, and when we had them all there one of
us went inside to open the window to take the
rifles from the other girls as they handed them
through.  We were delighted to handle the arms.
</p>

<p>
Later on one of the neighbors said that it
was wrong to leave the rifles there.  "There is
a retired sergeant of the police who lives a
little way up the road and he wouldn't be above
telling about them."
</p>

<p>
This rather frightened us.  If the police
came and took them from us, what could we
do?  I decided to go in to Dublin and go to
the Volunteer office and tell them about the
rifles.  When I had told about the rifles two
of the men present accompanied me back to the
camp to take the rifles from there.
</p>

<p>
We set off in another taxi and arrived at the
camp before there was any sign of the police
becoming active.  All the rifles were carried
out again and put in the taxi.  When they
were all in it, it was suggested that we should
get into the taxi and sit on top of the rifles.
The police would be less suspicious of a taxi
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
with girls in it.  It was not a very comfortable
seat that we had on that trip to Dublin.  But
the rifles were saved.  When we got back to
the office I offered to sit in any taxi with the
rifles if they thought it would divert attention.
I sat on quite a number of rifles that day.  And
at the end of the day I had a rifle of my own.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the bodies of those who had
been shot by the soldiers were laid out and
brought to the Cathedral.  Preparations were
made for a public funeral to honor the victims
of English soldiery in Ireland.  All the
Volunteers were to march in honor of the dead,
and the local trades unions, the Irish Citizen
Army, the Cumami na mBan, the Fianna, and
as many of the citizens of Dublin as desired to
do so.  The Fintan Lalor Pipe Band, connected
with the Irish Transport and General
Workers Union, were to play the Dead March.
And there was to be a firing party of the Irish
Volunteers who were to use the rifles that had
so soon been the cause of bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
I spent all the day of the funeral making
wreaths.  The funeral was not to take place
till the evening so as to permit all who wished
to attend to do so.  The Fianna boys went
round to the different florists asking for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
flowers to make wreaths to place on the graves of
the dead.  And they were richly rewarded.
Every florist they went to gave bunches and
bunches of their best flowers, and these the
boys brought to Madame's house.  Madame
and I, and two or three other girls, worked
continually all during the afternoon turning the
flowers into wreaths.  When we had finished
we had seventeen glorious big wreaths.  Just
before six we piled into an automobile, some
of the boys in Gaelic costume stood on the
running board.  The saffron and green of the
kilts and the many wreaths made quite an
artistic dash of color when we arrived at
Beresford Place to have our place assigned to us.
</p>

<p>
The bodies of the five victims were removed
from the Cathedral and placed in the hearses.
Behind each one walked the chief mourners.
Much interest was aroused by the sight of a
soldier in the English uniform, who marched,
weeping openly, after one of the hearses.  He
had joined the English Army and had promised
to protect the English King, and now the
soldiers of that king had shot and killed his
innocent defenseless mother.
</p>

<p>
Dublin was profoundly moved as the funeral
cortege passed through the city.  Thousands
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
upon thousands marched to the cemetery after
the hearses, and thousands more lined the
streets.  They were attesting their sympathy
with the families of the dead, and their realization
that England still intended to rule Ireland
with the rifle and the bullet.
</p>

<p>
The firing party, as they marched after the
hearses with their rifles reversed, excited much
comment.  The people contrasted the difference
in the treatment accorded the Nationalists
when they had a gun-running, with that
accorded the Ulster gun-runners.  And they
knew once more that England would kill and
destroy them rather than permit them to have
the means to protect their lives and to fight for
their liberties.
</p>

<p>
The authorities were aware of the feeling
aroused in the people by the killing of the
unarmed women and men, and to prevent any
further disturbance they confined the soldiers
to their barracks that evening.  Still the
feeling against "The King's Own Scottish Borderers"
(the regiment that had done the shooting)
ran so high that the entire regiment was
secretly sent away from Dublin.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
About one week later, while the people were
still incensed at the shooting, England went to
war.  Almost immediately she issued an appeal
to the Irish to join her army.  Later she
appealed to them to avenge the shooting of the
citizens of Catholic Belgium.  Because her
memory was short, or perhaps because her need
was so great she chose to ignore the fact that
English soldiers had but shortly shot down
and killed the unarmed citizens of Catholic
Dublin.  But Dublin did not forget.
</p>

<p>
The Irish Citizen Army distinguished itself
when John Redmond and Mr. Asquith, who
was then Prime Minister, came over to Dublin
shortly after the outbreak of the war.  They
came to hold a recruiting meeting in the
Mansion House.  It was supposed to be a public
meeting at which the Prime Minister and the
Irish Parliamentary Leader would appeal to
the citizens of Dublin to enlist in the British
Army; yet no one was let in without a card of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
admission.  A cordon of soldiers were drawn
across both ends of the street in which the
Mansion House was situated, at Nassau Street
and at St. Stephen's Green.  No one could
pass these cordons without presenting the card
and being subjected to a close scrutiny by the
local detectives.  This was to make sure that
no objectionable person could get in to the
meeting and make a row.  But the Nationalists
of Dublin had no intention of going to the
meeting; there was to be another one that would
give them more pleasure.
</p>

<p>
A monster demonstration had been decided
upon by the Irish Citizen Army to prove to
Mr. Asquith, and through him to England,
that the mass of the Dublin people were against
recruiting for the British Army.  They
mustered outside of Liberty Hall.  The speakers,
amongst whom was Sean Mac Dermott who
was there to represent the Irish Volunteers,
were on a lorry guarded by members of the
Irish Citizen Army armed with rifles and fixed
bayonets; a squad similarly armed guarded the
front and the rear.  They were determined
that there would be no arrest of anti-recruiters
that night.
</p>

<p>
They marched around the city, the crowd
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
swelling as they went, and they stopped at the
"Traitors' Arch" (the popular name for the
Memorial to the Irish soldiers who fell in the
Boer War), at St. Stephen's Green, two blocks
away from where the recruiting meeting was
being held.  As speaker after speaker
denounced recruiting, and denounced England,
and Redmond, and Asquith, feeling surged
higher and higher until it reached a climax
when James Connolly called on those present
to declare for an Irish Republic.  Cheers
burst from thousands of throats and a forest of
hands appeared in the air as they declared for
a Republic.  We were told afterwards that
the recruiting meeting had to stop till the
anti-recruiters stayed their cheering.
</p>

<p>
The armed men of the Irish Citizen Army
resumed the march first to make sure that none
would be molested.  Down Grafton Street
they went and halted again beside the old
House of Parliament, where Jim Larkin called
on them to raise their right hands and pledge
themselves never to join the British Army.
Every one present did so.  Then, whistling
and singing Nationalist marching tunes and
anti-recruiting songs, they marched back to
Liberty Hall and dispersed.  As a result of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
Asquith's meeting, or because of the Irish
Citizen Army meeting, only six men joined the
British Army next day.
</p>

<p>
Midnight mobilizations were a feature of the
Irish Citizen Army.  They served a twofold
purpose.  They taught the men to be ready
whenever called upon, and were a great source
of annoyance to the police.  At every mobilization
of the Irish Citizen Army a squad of
police and detectives were detailed by the
authorities to follow and report all the
movements.  One midnight the men mobilized at
Liberty Hall; they were divided into two
bodies, the attacking and the defending.  They
marched to the North side of the city, one body
going across the canal, and the other remaining
behind to prevent the entrance of the
attackers.  The battle lasted two hours.  It was
a bitter winter's night and the police were on
duty all the time as they did not dare to leave,
for there was no telling what the Irish Citizen
Army might be up to.

<p>
After the men had completed their evolutions
around the bridge they formed ranks and
marched round the city, the police following
them.  They stopped at Emmet Hall, Inchicore,
for refreshments.  There they had a song
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
and dance, one chap remarking that the
thought of the "peelers" (police) and the "G
men" (detectives) outside in the cold added to
the enjoyment.  They broke up about six
o'clock a.m. and marched back to Liberty Hall
followed by the disheartened, miserable, frozen
police.
</p>

<p>
There was another midnight mobilization
later on.  Announcements were made publicly
that on this occasion the Irish Citizen Army
would attack Dublin Castle, the center of
English Government in Ireland for 600 years.  The
thought of such a deed never fails to fire the
imagination of an Irish Nationalist.  A favorite
phrase of one of the officers of the Irish
Citizen Army, Commandant Sean Connolly,
was, "One more rush, boys, and the Castle is
ours."  He was in command of the body that
attacked the Castle on Easter Monday.  It
was while calling on his men to rush the Castle
that he received a bullet through his brain,
thus achieving his lifelong dream of dying for
Ireland while attacking the Castle.
</p>

<p>
One other mobilization which took place at
midnight some time before the Rising was a
disappointment, perhaps because it was
unofficial.  One of the Irish Citizen Army men
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
heard that a number of rifles were stored in a
place near Finglass.  He knew the whereabouts
and whispered the news amongst his
comrades.  A number of them decided to make
a raid on the place and capture the rifles.
They started out at midnight, marched twenty
miles before morning, but, unfortunately, the
rifles had been removed before they arrived.
They were disappointed but not downhearted;
such things they considered part of the day's
work.
</p>

<p>
They had another disappointment which was
more amusing, at least our men could laugh
at it when a few days were past.  There was
in Dublin a body of men called the Home
Defense Corps.  They wore a greenish gray
uniform and on their sleeves an armlet with the
letters "G.R." in red&mdash;abbreviations for
Georgius Rex.  They were called the
"Gorgeous Wrecks" by the Dubliners.  They were
mainly men past the military age who had
registered their willingness to fight the
Germans when they invaded England, Scotland,
or Ireland.  These men paraded the streets of
Dublin making a fine show with their uniforms
and rifles, especially the rifles.  Some of the
Irish Citizen Army thought those rifles too
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
good to be left in the hands of "those old ones"
and followed them on a march to find out where
the rifles were kept.  When our men came
back they gathered a number of their friends
together; after a short talk away they went
for the rifles.  It was done in quite a military
manner; sentries and pickets were placed, the
building surrounded and entered.  Several
made their way to the room where the rifles
were kept and opened the windows to hand the
rifles to the eager hands outside.  Their plan
was to march home with them quite openly as
if returning from a route march.
</p>

<p>
The leader of the band was well known for
his lurid and swift flow of language.  Suddenly
bursting out, he surpassed all his previous
efforts and completely staggered the men
around him&mdash;they beheld him examining one
of the rifles.  It was complete in every detail,
just like an army rifle, but on lifting it it was
easy to know that it was a very clever imitation.
The men were heartbroken and disgusted,
but they brought several of the rifles
away with them to show their officers what the
"Gorgeous Wrecks" were going to fight the
Germans with.  During a raid by the Dublin
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
police in a well-known house one of these rifles
was taken away by them.  How long it took
them to realize its uselessness we do not know
as it was never returned.

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
Towards the end of 1915 the hearts of the
Irish Citizen Army beat high, when they were
summoned one night for special business.  One
by one they were called into a room where
their Commandant, James Connolly, and his
Chief of Staff, Michael Mallin, were seated at
a table.  They were bound on their word not
to reveal anything they should hear until the
time came.  Something like the following
conversation took place:
</p>

<p>
"Are you willing to fight for Ireland?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It might mean your death."
</p>

<p>
"No matter."
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready to fight to-morrow if asked?"
</p>

<p>
"Whenever I'm wanted."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think we ought to fight with the
few arms we've got?"
</p>

<p>
"Why wait?  England can get millions to one."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
</p>

<p>
"It might mean a massacre."
</p>

<p>
"In God's name let us fight, we've been
waiting long enough."
</p>

<p>
"The Irish Volunteers might not come out
with us.  Are you still ready?"
</p>

<p>
"What matter?  We can put up a good fight."
</p>

<p>
"Then in God's name hold yourself ready.
The Day is very near."
</p>

<p>
To the eternal credit of the Irish Citizen
Army be it recorded that only one man shirked
that night.
</p>

<p>
Then on top of this glorious happening came
the attempted raid on Liberty Hall by the
police.  That morning I was in the office with
my father when a man came from the printer's
shop and said, "Mr. Connolly, you're wanted
downstairs."  My father went downstairs.
About five minutes later he came into the office
again, took down a carbine, loaded it and filled
his pockets with cartridges.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" I asked.  "Can I do anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Stay here, I'll need you," said my father
and he left the office again.  He was gone
about five minutes when the door was banged
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
open and the Countess de Markievicz burst
into the office.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Mr. Connolly?" she demanded
excitedly.  "Where's Mr. Connolly?  They're
raiding the Gaelic press&mdash;the place is
surrounded with soldiers."
</p>

<p>
"He left here five minutes ago," I said.  "He
took his carbine with him and told me to
remain here as he would need me."
</p>

<p>
She ran out again.  In a few minutes I
heard her and my father coming back along the
corridor.  She was talking excitedly and my
father was laughing.
</p>

<p>
They came into the office&mdash;he took down a
sheaf of papers and commenced signing them.
They called for instant mobilization of the
Irish Citizen Army.  They were to report at
Liberty Hall with full equipment at once.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Nora," said my father.  "It looks as
if we were in for it and as if they were going
to force our hands.  Fill up these orders as I
sign them.  I want two hundred and fifty."
</p>

<p>
I busied myself filling in these orders.  The
Countess began to help me&mdash;suddenly she
stopped and cried out, "But, Mr. Connolly, I
haven't my pistol on me."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Madame," said my father.
"We'll give you one."
</p>

<p>
"Give it to me now," she said.  "So my
mind will be easy."
</p>

<p>
She was given a large Mauser pistol.  Just
then a picket came running in.  He saluted
and said, "They've left the barracks, sir."  He
was referring to the police.  A line of our
pickets had been stationed reaching from the
barracks to Liberty Hall; their duty was to
report any move they might see made by the
police.  In that way no sooner had a body of
police left the barracks than word was sent
along the line and in less than three minutes
Liberty Hall was aware of it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Madame," said my father when the
picket had gone. "Come along, we'll be ready
for them.  Finish those, Nora, and come down
to me with them."
</p>

<p>
I finished them and went down to the
Co-operative shop.  Behind the counter stood my
father with his carbine laid along it; beside
him Madame, and outside the counter was
Miss Moloney taking the safety catch from off
her automatic.  I gave the batch of orders to
my father; he called one of the men who stood
in the doorway, and said, "Get these around at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
once."  The man saluted and went away.  Just
then another picket came in and said, "They
will be here in a minute, sir, they've just
crossed the bridge."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said my father, and the men
went away.
</p>

<p>
Miss Moloney then told me that some policemen
had come in and had attempted to search
the store, and that she had sent word to
Mr. Connolly through the men in the printing shop,
which was back of the Coöperative shop; and
then busied herself resisting the search.  One
policeman had a batch of papers in his hands
when my father came in.  He saw at once what
was going forward, drew his automatic pistol,
pointed it at the policeman and said:
</p>

<p>
"Drop them or I'll drop you."
</p>

<p>
The policeman dropped them.  My father
then asked what he wanted.  He said they had
come to confiscate any copies of <i>The Gael</i>, <i>The
Gaelic Athlete</i>, <i>Honesty</i> or <i>The Spark</i> that
might be on the premises.
</p>

<p>
"Have you a search warrant?" asked my
father.  This was a bluff, because under the
Defense of the Realm Act any house may be
searched on suspicion; but it worked; the
policeman said he had none.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Go and get one," said my father, "or you'll
not search here."
</p>

<p>
The police went away; and it was then that
my father had come back to the office to sign
the mobilization papers.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards there came into the shop
an Inspector of the police, four plain-clothes
men and two policemen in uniform.  I was
behind the counter at this time.
</p>

<p>
"I am Inspector Banning," said the Inspector.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" asked my father.
</p>

<p>
"We have come to search for, and confiscate
any, of the suppressed papers we may find here."
</p>

<p>
"Where's your warrant?" asked my father.
</p>

<p>
"I have it here," said the Inspector.
</p>

<p>
"Read it," said my father.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector read the warrant&mdash;it was to
the effect that all shops and newsvendors were
to be searched, and all copies of the suppressed
newspapers confiscated.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said my father when the Inspector
had finished reading.  "This is the shop up to
this door,"&mdash;pointing to one behind him,&mdash;"beyond
this door is Liberty Hall, and through
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
this door you will not go.  Go ahead and
search."
</p>

<p>
"We have no desire to enter Liberty Hall,"
said the Inspector.
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt you," said my father, whereat
we all grinned.
</p>

<p>
At an order from the Inspector one of the
policemen began to search around the place
where the papers were kept.  He looked at my
father standing in the doorway with his
carbine, and for a moment we thought he was
going to rush him.  Perhaps visions of stripes
danced before him; but, at an order from his
superior he went on with his work.  It was a
good thing for him that he did so, as there were
the best of shots present, with less than ten
paces between him and them.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing here," he said at last to
the Inspector.  (We had made sure there would
not be.)  And then they all left the shop.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, a series of strange sights
were to be seen all over the city.  The mobilization
orders had gone forth and the men were
answering them.  Women in the fashionable
shopping districts were startled by the sight of
men, with their faces still grimed with the dust
of their work, tearing along at a breakneck
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
speed, a rifle in one hand and a bandolier in the
other.
</p>

<p>
Out from the ships where they were working;
from the docks; out of the factories; in
from the streets,&mdash;racing, panting, with eager
faces and joyful eyes they trooped into Liberty
Hall.  Joyful because they believed the call
had come at last.
</p>

<p>
No obstacle was great enough to prevent
their answering the order.  One batch were
working in a yard overlooking a canal.  A man
appeared at the door, whistled to one of the
men and gave him a sign.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, boys, we're needed," cried one
and made for the door.  The foreman, thinking
it was a strike, closed the door.  Nothing
daunted they swarmed the walls, jumped into
the canal, swam across, ran to their homes for
their rifles and equipment and arrived at
Liberty Hall, wet and happy.  Another batch
were busy with a concrete column and had just
got it to the critical period, where one must not
stop working or it hardens and cannot be used,
when the mobilizer appeared at the door and
gave them the news.  Down went the tools
and out they went through the gate in the
twinkling of an eye.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
</p>

<p>
All day long the men were arriving at
Liberty Hall.  Tense excitement prevailed
amongst the crowds that came thronging
outside the Hall.  A guard was placed at the
great front door, another at the head of the
wide staircase and the rest were confined to
the guard room.  This guard room had a great
fascination for me.  The men were sitting on
forms around an open fire; ranged along the
walls were their rifles, and hanging above them
their bandoliers; at the butts of the rifles were
their haversacks containing the rest of their
equipment; all was so arranged that when they
received an order each man would be armed
and equipped within a minute, and there would
be no confusion or delay.  When I first went
in the men were singing, with great gusto, this
Citizen Army marching tune:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We've got guns and ammunition, we know how to use them well,<br>
  And when we meet the Saxon we'll drive them all to Hell.<br>
  We've got to free our country, and avenge all those who fell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our cause is marching on.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory, glory to old Ireland,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory, glory to our sireland,<br>
  Glory to the memory of those who fought and fell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we still keep marching; on.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="capcenter">

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
</p>

<p>
I knew then what was meant by sniffing a
battle.  I did not want to leave that room.
The atmosphere thrilled me so that I regarded
with impatience the men and women who were
going about the Hall attending to the regular
business of the Union, and not in the least
perturbed by all the military display.  "Business
as usual," one chap remarked to me as I
stood watching them all.
</p>

<p>
I did not stand long, for a Citizen Army
man came to me and said, "You're wanted in
No. 7 by Mr. Connolly."  No. 7 was my father's
office.  When I got there my father said,
"Nora, I have a carbine up at Surrey House
and a bandolier.  It is in my room."  He then
told me where.  "I want you to get one of the
scouts, who are always at Madame's house, to
put the bandolier on and over it my heavy
overcoat.  Tell him to swing the rifle over his
shoulder and come down here with it as if he
were mobilizing.  Get him here as soon as you
can.  I'll be staying here all night," he added.
</p>

<p>
I started off immediately for Rathmines
where Surrey House, Countess de Markievicz's
residence, is situated.  On my way I met
one of the scouts who was going there.  When
I told him my errand he offered to be the one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
to bring the things back to Liberty Hall.
When we reached the house, I went to the
room, found the things which my father wanted
and brought them down to the scout.  He had
just put them on when Madame called from
the kitchen and asked me to have some tea.
Of course I said I would have some.  While I
was waiting to be served she said to me, "What
do you think is going to happen?  I am going
down to Liberty Hall immediately to take my
turn of standing guard.  By-the-way, what do
you think of my uniform?"
</p>

<p>
She stepped out into the light where I could
get a good view of her.  She had on a dark
green woolen blouse trimmed with brass buttons,
dark green tweed knee breeches, black
stockings and high heavy boots.  As she stood
she was a good advertisement for a small arms
factory.  Around her waist was a cartridge
belt, suspended from it on one side was a small
automatic pistol, and on the other a convertible
Mauser pistol-rifle.  Hanging from one shoulder
was a bandolier containing the cartridges
for the Mauser, and from the other was a
haversack of brown canvas and leather which
she had bought from a man, who had got it
from a soldier, who in turn had brought it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
back from the front; originally it had belonged
to a German soldier.  I admired her whole
outfit immensely.  She was a fine military
figure.
</p>

<p>
"You look like a real soldier, Madame," I
said, and she was as pleased as if she had
received the greatest compliment.
</p>

<p>
"What is your uniform like?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Somewhat similar," I answered.  "Only I
have puttees and my boots have plenty of nails
in the soles.  I intend wearing my scout blouse
and hat."
</p>

<p>
"This will be my hat," she said and showed
me a black velour hat with a heavy trimming
of coque feathers.  When she put it on she
looked like a Field Marshal; it was her best hat.
</p>

<p>
"What arms have you?" she then asked.
</p>

<p>
"A .32 revolver and a Howth rifle."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ammunition for them?"
</p>

<p>
"Some.  Perhaps enough."
</p>

<p>
I then turned to the scout who was to carry
my father's rifle and bandolier to Liberty
Hall, and said, "We'd better go now."  Saying
"Slán libh" ("Health with ye") we left
the room.  On our way to the door we heard
a heavy rap at it.  I ran forward and opened
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
it.  Judge of my surprise to see two detectives
standing outside.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The Countess de Markievicz."
</p>

<p>
"Wait," I said and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
Running back to the room I said, "Madame,
there are two detectives at the door.  They say
they want you."
</p>

<p>
All the boys looked to their revolvers, and
the boy who had my father's rifle said, "I hope
I'll be able to get these down to Mr. Connolly."
</p>

<p>
Madame went into the hall and lit a small
glimmer of light.  The boys remained in the
darkened background, and I opened the door.
</p>

<p>
The detectives came just inside of the door.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want with me?" asked Madame.
</p>

<p>
"We have an order to serve on you,
Madame," said one of them.
</p>

<p>
"What is it about?" asked Madame.
</p>

<p>
"It is an order under one of the regulations
of the Defense of the Realm Act, prohibiting
you from entering that part of Ireland called Kerry."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Madame.  "Is that to prevent
me from addressing the meeting to-morrow
night in Tralee?"  Madame was advertised to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
at a meeting to organize a company of
boy scouts the following day in the town of
Tralee, County Kerry.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Madame," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"What will happen to me if I refuse to obey
that order and go down to Kerry to-morrow?"
asked Madame.  "Will I be shot?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, now, Madame, who'd want to shoot
you?  You wouldn't want to shoot one of us,
would you, Madame?" said the detective who
was doing all the talking.
</p>

<p>
"But I would," cried Madame.  "I'm quite
prepared to shoot and be shot at."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, now, Madame, you don't mean that.
None of us want to die yet: we all want to
live a little longer."
</p>

<p>
"If you want to live a little longer," said a
voice from out of the darkness, "you'd better
not be coming here.  We're none of us very
fond of you, and you make fine big targets."
</p>

<p>
"We'll be going now, Madame," said the
detective.  As he stepped out through the door
he turned and said, "You'll not be thinking of
going to Kerry, Madame, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Good-by," said Madame cordially.  "Remember,
I'm quite prepared to shoot and be shot at."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said as the door closed.  "What
am I going to do now?  I want to go and defy
them.  How can I do it?  I'm so well known&mdash;but
I'm under orders.  Perhaps Mr. Connolly
wouldn't allow me to go anyway.  I'll go down
and talk it over with him.  Wait a minute,
Nora, and we'll all be down together."
</p>

<p>
On our way down a brilliant idea, as I
thought, struck me.  "Write your speech out,
Madame, make it as seditious and treasonable
as possible.  Send some one down to Tralee to
deliver it for you at the meeting.  In that way,
the meeting will be held, your speech delivered,
and the authorities will not be able to arrest
you on that charge."
</p>

<p>
"I was just thinking of that and who I could
send down.  But I'll decide nothing till I see
Mr. Connolly," said Madame.
</p>

<p>
We met my father at the top of the staircase
in Liberty Hall.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Mr. Connolly," cried
Madame.  "I've received an internment order
or rather an order prohibiting me from going
down to Tralee.  What am I going to do about
it?  Shall I go or shall I obey the order."
</p>

<p>
"Did you bring the carbine and bandolier?"
asked my father turning to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered.  "Harry has them."
</p>

<p>
"No, Madame," said my father.  "You cannot
go down to Tralee.  If you make the attempt
you will probably be arrested at some
small station on the way, and sentenced to
some months in jail.  You are too valuable
to be a prisoner at a time like this; I'll have
need of you.  If the authorities follow up their
action of to-day we may be in the middle of
things to-night or to-morrow; who knows?  No,
you must stay here.  You are more important
than the meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Should I send some one in my place, then?"
asked Madame.
</p>

<p>
"That is for you to decide, though I think
it would be a good thing."
</p>

<p>
"Whom will I send?" asked Madame.
</p>

<p>
"Send some one who cannot be victimized in
case our hands are not forced; some one who is
already victimized.  Why not ask Mairé Perolz?"
</p>

<p>
"The very girl!" said Madame.  "You can
always pick out the right person."
</p>

<p>
"You had better get hold of Perolz, then,"
said my father.  "Tell her what you want her
to do and write out your speech.  We'll relieve
you of guard duty to-night, and promise you
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
that if things look lively we'll get word to you
in time."
</p>

<p>
Madame left the Hall, and when I returned
to her house a few hours later, she was busy
writing out her speech.  I sat down in the
room and from time to time she read me out
parts of it.  It certainly was seditious and
treasonable.  She wrote on for quite some time
after that and then with a sigh of satisfaction
she said, "I have it finished.  Perolz will come
for it in the morning&mdash;she will take an early
train."
</p>

<p>
Perolz had come and gone before I came
down in the morning, but when she returned
a few days later, I heard the whole story of
her adventure, told in her own inimitable way.
</p>

<p>
She had traveled down to Limerick Junction
accompanied by a very polite, attentive
detective, whose company she dispensed with
there by leaving the carriage she was in at the
very last minute, and taking a seat in another.
Hers was not a case of impersonation, for the
Countess de Markievicz is very tall and rather
fair while Mairé Perolz is of medium height
and has red hair.  She is very quick-witted and
nimble of her tongue, never at a loss for what
to do or for what to say.

<br>
THE PROCLAMATION OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED AT <br>
THE G.P.O. ON MONDAY, APRIL 24TH, 1917.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
</p>

<p>
She was met at Tralee station by a guard
of honor from the local Cumann na mBan
(women's organization), Irish Volunteers,
and intending boy scouts.  They had never
seen the Countess de Markievicz and consequently
did not know that it was not she who
had arrived.  Although Mairé told me that
she almost lost her composure when she heard
one of the girls say, "She isn't a bit like her
photograph."
</p>

<p>
She was escorted to the hotel.  When she
arrived there she said to the officers of the
organization, "I am not Madame Markievicz.
She received an order last night prohibiting
her from entering Kerry.  Things were looking
lively in Dublin and Madame was needed.
She wrote out her speech and I am to deliver
it for her.  In that way the meeting will be
held and Madame's speech will be delivered,
and Madame will still be able to do useful
work.  There is no need to let the public know
till to-night."
</p>

<p>
The officers agreed that it would be best to
keep the knowledge of the non-arrival of
Madame from the public and the police.  Just
then the proprietor of the hotel came to the
door and said, "Madame, there are two
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
policemen downstairs and they want your registration
form at once."  Under the Defense of the
Realm Act every one entering an hotel, or
boarding or lodging house is required to fill in
a form declaring his name, address, occupation,
and intended destination.  This rule was most
rigidly enforced by the police authorities.
</p>

<p>
"Can't they wait till I get a cup of tea?"
asked Mairé.
</p>

<p>
"No.  They said they would wait and take
it back to the station with them."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Mairé.  "Give it to me."
</p>

<p>
She filled out the form something like this,
neglecting the minor details.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  <i>Name</i>:&mdash;Mairé Perolz.<br>
  <i>Address</i>:&mdash;No fixed address&mdash;vagrant.<br>
  <i>Age</i>:&mdash;20?<br>
  <i>Occupation</i>:&mdash;None.<br>
  <i>Nationality</i>:&mdash;Irish.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She then gave it to the proprietor who took
it away.  From the window they watched the
policemen carrying it to the police station,
apparently very much absorbed in it.  They
returned shortly and asked to see the lady.  When
they came in to the room they still carried the
registration form.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't filled in this form satisfactorily,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
Madame," said one.  "You must have
some fixed address and some occupation."
</p>

<p>
"No indeed," said Mairé.  "I live on my wits."
</p>

<p>
"And you are a Russian subject."
</p>

<p>
"How do you make that out, in the name of
God?" asked Mairé.
</p>

<p>
"You are married to a Russian Count."

<p>
"First news I've heard of it," said Mairé.
"Now listen here, I've filled that form out
correctly and you'll have to be satisfied with it.
I'll not fill out another."
</p>

<p>
They accepted the form at last.  That night
Mairé delivered Madame's speech, told why
Madame could not be present, then added a
little anti-recruiting speech of her own which
evoked great applause.  The next day she
returned home in great spirits at having once
more helped to outwit the police.

<p>
About this time the Executive of the Cumann
na mBan (women's organization) in Dublin
were having trouble in procuring First Aid
and Hospital supplies.  I suggested that being
a Northerner and having a Northern accent, I
could probably get them in Belfast.  I knew
that a number of loyalist nursing corps were in
existence in that city, and thought that by
letting it be inferred that I belonged to one of
them, the loyalist shopkeepers would have no
hesitation in selling me the supplies, and in all
probability would let me have them at cost
price.  And that is exactly what happened.  I
purchased as many of the different articles as
I needed and at less than half the price paid in
Dublin.
</p>

<p>
While in Dublin I had visited the Employment
Bureau in the Volunteer Headquarters.
Its business was to find employment for Irishmen
and boys who were liable for military service.
Under the Military Service Act every
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
man or boy over eighteen, residing in England
or Scotland since the preceding August, was
required to report himself for service in the
British Army.  The Bureau found employment
in most cases for those who preferred to
serve in the Irish Republican Army and had
come to Ireland to await the call.  Of course, it
was impossible to find jobs for them all; but
those who had not received jobs were busy on
the work of making ammunition and hand
grenades for the Irish Republican Army.  The
greater number of them had to camp out
during the miserable months of February and
March, in the Dublin Mountains, so that too
great a drain would not be placed on their
slender resources.
</p>

<p>
On my return to Belfast at a meeting of the
Cumann na mBan I suggested that we send
hampers of foodstuffs down to those boys and
men in Dublin.  The suggestion was taken up
with great gusto, and the members were
divided into different squads; a butter squad, a
bacon squad, a tea, a sugar, oatmeal, cheese,
and tinned goods squad; and they were to
solicit all their friends for these articles.  They
were then to be sent on to the different camps
in Dublin to help on the fight.  Since we had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
done so well on the foodstuffs I thought it
would be as well to ask the men and boys in
Belfast for cigarettes and tobacco.  I set about
collecting on the Saturday on which we
intended sending away the first hamper of food.
I was so successful that I was unable to
return home for lunch before half-past three.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived home my sister met me at
the door and said there was a man in the
parlor who wanted to see me, and that he had
been waiting since noon.  I went into the room
and saw one of my Dublin friends.
</p>

<p>
"Why, hello, Barney," I said.  "What
brings you here?"
</p>

<p>
He told me that there was some work before
me and that he had the instructions.  With
this he handed me a letter.  I recognized my
father's handwriting on the envelope.  The
letter merely said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Dear Nora</i>, The bearer will tell you what we want
you to do.  I have every confidence in your ability.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your father,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"JAMES CONNOLLY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What are we to do?" I asked turning to Barney.
</p>

<p>
"Liam Mellowes is to be deported to-morrow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
morning to England and we are to go
there and bring him back."
</p>

<p>
"Sounds like a big job," I said.  "What are
the plans?"
</p>

<p>
"These are some of them," he answered
showing me several pages closely written.
"Some one will bring the final instructions
from Dublin to-night."
</p>

<p>
The plan in the rough was that the messenger,
being on the first glance uncommonly
like Liam Mellowes, was to go to the place
where he was interned and visit him.  While
he was visiting he was to change clothes with
Liam Mellowes and stay behind, while Liam
came out to me.  We were then to make all
speed to the station and lose no time in
returning to Dublin.
</p>

<p>
Liam Mellowes had received, some time previously,
an order from the military authorities
to leave Ireland.  This was because of his many
activities as an organizer for the Irish
Volunteers&mdash;as the order had it, because he was
prejudicial to recruiting.  He refused to obey
and had been arrested.  He was now to be
forcibly deported.  As Mellowes was absolutely
essential to the plans for the Rising, being
Officer in charge of the operations in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
West of Ireland, the attempt to bring him
back from England was decided upon.
</p>

<p>
While waiting for the messenger to bring
the final instructions from Dublin I sent out
word to some of the Cumann na mBan girls
that I should like to see them.  When they
came I told them that I had received an order
that necessitated my going to Dublin; and that
I should not be able to assist them in sending
away the hampers.  I gave them the money
that I had collected for the cigarettes and
tobacco, and they said they would see that
everything went away all right.  It was with great
surprise and delight that the "refugees," as
we called them, received the hampers a few
days later.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
After the girls left I fell to studying the
instructions.  The main idea was to go in as
zig-zag a course as possible to our objective.
My father had made out a list of the best
possible places to break our journey.  On one
sheet of paper in Eamonn Ceannt's handwriting
continued the plan; and on another, in
Sean mac Diarmuida's, was a list of people
with their addresses in England or Scotland,
to whom we could go for safe hiding, if we
found we were being followed by detectives.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after seven that evening Miss
Moloney arrived at our house.  She brought us
a message from Dublin.  It was to the effect
that it was not yet known to what place Liam
Mellowes was to be deported, but we were to
go on our journey, and when we arrived at
Birmingham, there would be a message waiting
us there with the desired information.  All
that was known was that Liam Mellowes was
to be deported to some town in the South of
England.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span></p>

<p>
There was a boat leaving for Glasgow that
night at eleven forty-five.  We decided to go
on it; it was called the theatrical boat, because
it was on this boat many theatrical companies
left Belfast; we thought we would not be
noticed among the throng.  I was to ask for all
the tickets at the railway stations, as my
accent is not easily placed.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday morning I went up on deck
expecting to be almost the first one there;
Barney, however, was there before me.  He said
we would be in Glasgow shortly.  I went
below for my suitcase.  When I came up on deck
again I saw that we were nearer shore and that
we were slowing up.  I asked a steward if we
should be off soon.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  "We are slowing up here to
put some cattle off."
</p>

<p>
"Will it take long?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"About an hour."
</p>

<p>
"How far are we from Glasgow?" I then asked.
</p>

<p>
"Two or three miles."
</p>

<p>
"Can we get off here instead of waiting?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing to prevent you," he said.
</p>

<p>
So Barney and I picked up our traps and,
as soon as the gangway was fixed up for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
cattle to disembark, we went down it and on to
the quay.
</p>

<p>
We walked along as if we had been born
there, although as a matter of fact, neither
Barney nor I had been in that place before.
After a few minutes we came to a street with
tramway lines on it and decided to wait for a
car.  We boarded the first car that came along.
After riding in it for a long time we noticed
that instead of approaching the city we seemed
to be going farther away from it.  We left the
car at the next stop, and took another going
in the opposite direction, and after riding for
three-quarters of an hour arrived in Glasgow.
We were more than pleased to think that if
the police had noticed us when we went on the
Glasgow boat at Belfast, and had sent on word
for the Glasgow police to watch out for us, the
boat would arrive without us.
</p>

<p>
Our next stop was to be Edinburgh.  We
went to the station and inquired when the
Edinburgh train would be leaving.  There was
one leaving at eleven fifteen that would arrive
in Edinburgh some time about one o'clock.
We decided to go by it.  Then we remembered
that it was Sunday and that we had not been
to Mass; also that if we went by that train
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
it would be too late when we arrived at
Edinburgh to attend.  It was not quite ten o'clock
then; if we could find a church nearby, we
could go to Mass and still be in time for the
train.  But where was there a church?  "Look,
Barney," I cried suddenly.  "Here's an
Irish-looking guard.  We'll ask him to direct
us."  We asked him and he told us that there was
a Catholic church five minutes' walk away
from the station, and directed us to it.  It took
us more than five minutes to get there, but
we arrived in time and were back at the
station before the Edinburgh train left.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Edinburgh about one o'clock.
We were very tired as we had not slept on the
boat; and we were hungry for we had not eaten
in our excitement at leaving the boat before
the time.  Our first thought was to find a place
to eat; but it was Sunday in Scotland and we
found no place open.  After wandering around
for some time, looking all about us, we
decided to ask a policeman.  He directed us to
the Waverley Hotel, where we were given a
good dinner.  And when we told the waiter
that we were only waiting till our train came
due, and that we wanted a place to rest, he
told us that we could stay in the room we were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
in.  After dinner I found myself nodding and
lay down on the couch.  I must have fallen
asleep almost instantly for it was dark when
I awoke.  Barney came in shortly afterwards.
He had been looking up the trains he said and
our train left at ten o'clock.  It was about
eight o'clock.  We had something more to eat
and left the hotel to go to the railway station.
To my great surprise when we came outside
everything was dark.  Not a light showed from
any of the buildings, or from the street cars.
Cabs and motors went by, and only for the
shouting of the drivers and the blowing of the
motor-horns we would have been run down
when crossing the streets.  We have no such
war regulation of darkness in Ireland.  We
arrived at the station at last.  We had to go down
a number of steps to get to the gate, and if it
was dark in the streets it was pitch blackness
down there.  I was not surprised at the number
of people I met on the steps, as I thought
it might be a usual rallying place, but I was
surprised to hear them talking in whispers.
We went down till we came to the gate&mdash;it
was closed and there was a man on guard at it.
</p>

<p>
"Can we not get in?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"To Carlisle."
</p>

<p>
"It's not time for the Carlisle train yet."
</p>

<p>
"But can't we go in and take our seats?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered, and after that I could
get no further response.
</p>

<p>
We waited awhile at the gate.  I noticed
that quite a few were given the same answers
although they were not going to the same place.
More time passed and I began to feel anxious;
I was afraid that we would miss the train.
</p>

<p>
"What time is it now?" I asked, turning to
Barney.  As he could not see in the dark he
lit a match.  Instantly, as with one voice, every
one around and on the steps shouted, "Put
out that light."  And the man at the gate
howled, "What the H&mdash;&mdash; does that fool
mean!"  We were more than surprised; we
did not know why we could not light a match.
</p>

<p>
Just after that a couple of soldiers came
towards the gate.  I could hear the rattle of
their hob-nailed boots and see the rifles swung
on their shoulders.  They talked with the man
at the gate for a few minutes, then saying, "All
right," went up the steps again.  This
happened more than once.  My eyes were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
accustomed to the darkness by now, and I could see
a sergeant, with about twenty soldiers,
coming down the steps.  As they made for the
gate I whispered to Barney, "Go close and
listen to what the guard says to the sergeant."  He
went&mdash;and as the sergeant turned away,
came back to me and picking up our bags said,
"Come on."  I followed without asking any
questions.  When we were out on the street
Barney turned to me and said, "The guard
told the sergeant to go to the other gate.  We'll
go too."
</p>

<p>
We followed the clacking sound of the soldiers'
boots till we came to a big gate.  It was
evidently the gate used for vehicles.  As we
entered we were stopped by two guards who
asked, "Where are you going?"  "To Carlisle,"
I answered.  They waved us inside.  We
walked down a long passageway.  When we
came to the train platforms, I asked a porter
who was standing near:
</p>

<p>
"Where is the train for Carlisle?"
</p>

<p>
"There'll be no train to-night, Miss," he
answered.
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, Miss," in a whisper, "the Zeppelins
were seen only eight miles away, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
a moving train would be a good mark for them."
</p>

<p>
"But they will not come here, will they?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"They are headed this way, Miss, they may
be here in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"Then we can't get to Carlisle?"
</p>

<p>
"To tell you the truth, Miss," he said, "I
don't think any train will run to-night, except
the military train.  Make up your mind you'll
not get to Carlisle to-night."
</p>

<p>
"When is there a train in the morning?"
I asked him then.
</p>

<p>
"There's one at eight-fifteen."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose we'll go by that one," I said.
</p>

<p>
And so we left the station.
</p>

<p>
We went back to the hotel.  We were
startled for a second when the registration
forms were handed to us; we hadn't decided on
a name or address.  I took the forms and filled
them with a Belfast address, put the one for
Barney in front of him, placing the pencil on
the name so that he would know what to sign.
After signing we were shown to our rooms.  I
went to bed immediately as I was completely
tired out.  I was roused from a heavy sleep
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
by a knocking on the door, and a voice saying
something I couldn't distinguish.  I thought
it was the "Boots" wakening me for breakfast,
and turned over to finish my sleep.  Some
time later I was again wakened by a loud
knocking on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" I called out.
</p>

<p>
"Barney," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"What is wrong?" I asked when I had
opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"The manageress came to me," said Barney,
"and said, 'Mr. Williams, go to your sister, I
am afraid she is either dead or has fainted with
the shock.'"
</p>

<p>
"What shock?" I asked, peering into the
black darkness but failing to see anything.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, only the Zeppelins have been
dropping bombs all over the town."
</p>

<p>
"What!" I cried.  "Zeppelins!  You don't
mean it.  Have I slept through all their bombing?"
</p>

<p>
"You have," he said dryly.  "The manageress
wants all guests down in the parlor, so that
in case this building is damaged, they'll all be
near the street.  Put something on and come down."
</p>

<p>
I put some clothes on me and went outside
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
the room.  I could not see my own hand in
front of me.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on to me," said Barney, "and I'll
bring you downstairs.  I know where the stairs
are."
</p>

<p>
"All right," I said, making a clutch at where
the voice was coming from.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better hold on to my back," said
Barney.  "That's the front of my shirt you've
got."
</p>

<p>
I slid my hand around till I felt the
suspenders at the back and held onto them.  "Go
ahead," I said, and we went.  I tried to
remember if the corridor was long or short, and
if there were any turns from the stairs to my
room, but I could not.  Never have I walked
along a corridor as long as that one seemed.
After a bit I said, "Barney, are you sure
you're going right?  I don't remember it being
as long as this."  We were going very slowly,
gingerly placing one foot after the other.
</p>

<p>
"We keep on," said Barney, "till we come
to a turn and then between two windows are
the stairs."  And so we went on, but we came
to no turning.  We were feeling our way by
placing our hands on the wall.  At last, we
felt an open space.  "Ah," said Barney, "this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
must be the stairs."  And although we did not
feel the windows we cautiously stepped
towards it.  It was not the stairs and I felt
curiously familiar with it.  I stumbled over
something on the floor and stooped to pick up&mdash;my
shoe.  We were back at my room!  We did not
know whether to laugh or to be annoyed.  We
began to laugh and Barney said, "Come on, I
know the way back to my room and from there
we'll find the stairs."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you strike a match?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We were warned not to, when the 'Boots'
knocked on the door," said Barney.  We went
along the corridor till Barney found his room.
From there he knew the turns of the corridor,
and at last we found the stairs.  Going down
I asked, "How is it that we are meeting none
of the people?"
</p>

<p>
"Because," said Barney, "they've been
down since the first knock and you had to be
wakened twice."
</p>

<p>
"I thought they were wakening me for
breakfast," I said.
</p>

<p>
The stairs seemed to twist and turn, and at
one of the turns I saw a figure standing at a
window, near a landing as I thought.
</p>

<p>
"Are we going the right way down to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
parlor?" I asked the figure, but received no reply.
</p>

<p>
"He's probably scared stiff and thinks he's
in a safe place," said Barney.  We reached
the foot of the stairs and one of the men took
us and led us towards the parlor.  All the
guests of the hotel were there huddled closely
around the remains of the fire.  I found a seat
and sat down.  There was very little talk.  I
could hear the guns going off very near.  One
of the women leaned toward me, and said,
"You were rather long getting down.  Did
you faint&mdash;were you frightened?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered.  "I slept through it all,
until my brother came and wakened me."
</p>

<p>
"You lucky girl!" she exclaimed in heart-felt tones.
</p>

<p>
We sat there for about an hour.  It was a
silent hour inside, but from outside came the
sound of running feet and hoarse excited
voices.  A motor car tore through the streets;
it must have had its lamps lit, for some one
yelled after it, "Put out those lights."
</p>

<p>
There was no sound of the Zeppelins again,
but the people in the parlor kept silent.  I felt
that one word spoken would set all their nerves
on edge.  Suddenly there was a long drawn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
"Oh!" followed by a thud.  I could feel every
one in the room quivering.  All turned to the
sound, but we could see nothing.  Then we
heard a man's voice say, "My boy has fainted."  They
ministered to him there in the darkness.
A few minutes later a delicate looking lad,
about twelve years old, was brought up to the
circle round the fire.  One of the women made
room for him and he sat on the floor with his
head resting on her knee.  The manageress
must have left the room during the excitement,
for she returned then and said, "We will not
be disturbed again, so we can go to bed and
finish our sleep."  The tension was lifted and
we all began talking as we made our way to
our rooms.
</p>

<p>
When I was going down the stairs next
morning, I was amazed to see that the figure
I had spoken to while trying to find my way,
was a statue.  The waiter told us, at
breakfast, that some bombs had been dropped in
the street back of the hotel.  They had killed
eight people, damaged one or two buildings,
and made a hole large enough to hold the
dining-room table.  He also said that he had heard
of a lot of other places, but that was the only
one he had seen.  We finished our breakfast
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
in a hurry and left for the station.  There we
bought a paper to read the full account of the
raid.  But all the mention of it was:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Zeppelins visited the East coast of Scotland last night.
No damage done."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On the journey to Carlisle the carriage was
so warm and the seats so soft that I became
drowsy.  I was about to yield when the other
occupants of the carriage came over to my side
and stared out of the windows.  As the
Zeppelins were still in my mind, I thought that
this might be one of the places they had visited,
and looked out of the window too.  All I could
see was a large field with brick buildings in
the center, somewhat like factories, only they
had sloping roofs made of glass.  There were
quite a crowd of men in the field.  "That's a
German Internment Camp," said one of the
men.  "There are over two thousand Germans
there."  The view of the camp started a
conversation on the war which lasted till we
reached Carlisle.

<p>
From Carlisle we were to go to Newcastle.
On looking up the timetable we found that we
could get a train in three-quarters of an hour.
We then left the station, so that if the porters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
were questioned as to whether they had seen
us or not they could say that we had left the
station.  In this way the trail would be broken
and would give us all the more time till it was
picked up again.  The journey from Carlisle
to Newcastle was not so long as the last one.
On arriving there we again left the station and
wandered about the town.  We had so much
more time there, and walked in and out of so
many streets, crossed so many crossings, that
my memory of Newcastle is very much blurred
and confused.  Before returning to the station
we went into a restaurant and ate the first
meal of our English trip.
</p>

<p>
Next we took tickets for Manchester, but
did not go there.  While we were on the train
we decided that we had better go to Crewe.
When the conductor came round for the
tickets, we asked him if this train would take
us to Crewe.  No, he said, but if it was to
Crewe we wanted to go he could change our
tickets at the next stop, and there we would
get a train for Crewe.  The next station was
Stalybridge, and there we took the train to
Crewe, where we arrived at one-thirty a.m.
</p>

<p>
From Crewe we went to Birmingham.  It
was there we were to receive information as to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
where Captain Mellowes had been deported.
We called at the address given to us and told
who we were.  Mr. Brown said that he had
just received word that we were coming, but
that was all.  There was no news for us about
the deportation.  This was both amazing and
puzzling; it was Tuesday and Captain
Mellowes was to have been deported on the
Sunday past.  Why had we received no word&mdash;and
what were we to do?  There was nothing
for us to do but wait.  A hotel was recommended
to us; we went there and registered
as brother and sister.  Our pose of being on a
holiday compelled us to stay out all day as if
sightseeing.  Tuesday we visited all the
principal buildings, Wednesday we walked all over
the city.  Thursday was a repetition of
Wednesday.  Friday, tired of each other's
company, we went out separately, and each
succeeded in losing the way, but managed to
arrive back at the hotel for supper.
</p>

<p>
Not knowing the city we had not ventured
out at night time, for like all other big cities
in England, Birmingham was darkened at
night-fall.  But on Friday we went out.  The
streets seemed to be all alike to us, we could
not tell one from the other.  The corners of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
curbstone were painted white, so as to
glimmer faintly and warn pedestrians when they
were approaching a crossing; policemen stood
in the center of the crossing flashing a lamp
attached to their belts, now a red light, now a
green one.  Trees, telegraph, telephone, and
trolley poles were painted white to the level
of the eyes.  Not a light showed anywhere,
not even at moving picture palaces; and as is
usual in darkness all voices were subdued.  I
am sure it is at night time that the people of
England realize most that they are at war.
</p>

<p>
Saturday came and still there was no news
for us.  We were not puzzled now.  We were
very anxious.  Something must have gone
wrong, we thought, or we would have had some
word before now.
</p>

<p>
We changed our hotel as we felt that the
people were becoming too interested in us.  At
the new hotel we registered as teachers on our
way to Stratford-on-Avon, where the Shakespeare
celebrations were in full swing.  We left
there in the morning, carried our suitcases to
the station, and left them in the Left Luggage
Office.  Then we went to Mr. Brown again to
find out if any word had come for us.  There
was a note for us there telling us to go to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
Midland Hotel.  When we arrived there we
met a young lady from Dublin.  She had come
over with the word.  She gave us the address
of Captain Mellowes, and told us to lose no
time.  We looked up the timetable and found
that there were no trains going there on
Sunday afternoon.  We were in despair till our
Birmingham friend told us he could hire a
private motor car for us.  He did so and we
left Birmingham at one-thirty p.m.
</p>

<p>
We traveled all afternoon through what is
known as the Black Country.  We did not
bother much with the scenery as we spent most
of our time in giving each other instruction
as to how to behave in different eventualities.
We had hired the car to take us to Stoke-on-Trent.
It was to return empty.  We thought
it would be a much safer plan if we could get
the car to take us back to some big station on
the line; thus instead of waiting at the local
station for a train, apprehending every
moment the discovery of Captain Mellowes' flight,
we should be well on our way before it could be
found out.  I did not expect that there would
be any trouble to get the chauffeur to bring
us back.  I figured that any money made on
the return trip would be his, and a working
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
man is always ready to make more money.
But it must be done in such a way as not to
arouse suspicion.
</p>

<p>
Secure in my figuring I spoke to the man.
I said, "I want you to take us to the railway
station at Stoke.  I expect a friend there to
pick us up."  He nodded.  It was dark when
we drew up at the station.  I said to the man,
"Wait a minute till I see if my friend is there
before we take out the things."  Then I went
into the station and walked in and out of the
waiting rooms, up and down the platform, and
asked a porter if there would be a train soon
to Leek (our real objective).  I returned and
said to Barney, "He is not there," and to the
man, "Have you any objections to going on to
Leek?  It is eight miles distant.  There won't
be a train for an hour, and I can have all my
business in Leek done in that time."  He said
he would take us there.  I then asked him if
he were going straight back to Birmingham.
He said he was.  "If you can wait three-quarters
of an hour, you can take us back
down the line to one of the big stations, and
be something in pocket.  The trains are so
irregular at small stations on Sundays."  He
said he could wait three-quarters of an hour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
</p>

<p>
When we arrived in Leek Barney and I
jumped out of the car as if we knew every
inch of the ground, although neither of us had
been in the city before.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we going?" asked Barney.
</p>

<p>
"When in doubt go right," I said, and we
turned to the right.  This town was darkened
too.  After a few minutes' walk I stopped an
old lady and asked her to direct us to the street
I wanted.  "Two streets up on the right," she
replied.  We found the place; it was an ordinary
house and to our surprise there were no
detectives watching it.  We knocked at the
door.  A man opened it about six inches and
peered at us.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he questioned.
</p>

<p>
"We are friends of Captain Mellowes and
heard he was staying here, so we stopped to see
him," I said.  "Is he in?"
</p>

<p>
"Come in till I take a look at you," he
answered.  After looking at us, "Come in here,"
he said, leading us to a room.  "I'll go find
him for you."
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes Captain Mellowes came
into the room.  He seemed surprised to see
us, and was about to enter into a conversation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
with us when Barney said, "I've an important
message to give you.  Where's your room?"
</p>

<p>
"Come upstairs," said Captain Mellowes,
rising at once.
</p>

<p>
They went upstairs.  I could hear them moving
about the room, and once in a while I heard
something fall on the floor as if they were
throwing different parts of their clothing to
each other.  After a few minutes' silence, I
heard footsteps on the stairs and went out to
the hall to be ready.  Both came down the
stairs, Captain Mellowes went forward and
opened the door while I was saying "good-by"
to Barney, who was remaining behind in the
Captain's place.  Barney left the house the
following day; he took a train at the local
station which ran to Crewe, and from there he
made connections that brought him back to
Ireland the day after the Captain's arrival.
</p>

<p>
Once outside the house, Captain Mellowes
and myself wasted no time in getting to the
car.  I asked the man had we kept him long
and he said we had been only half an hour.
He started the car and away we went again.
After three hours' ride we stopped at Stafford
Station.
</p>

<p>
"Can you not go as far as Crewe?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss," he replied.  "Crewe is altogether
out of my direction."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said.  "We'll leave here."  We
then left the car, gave the man his fee and
entered the station.  I took tickets for Crewe
and found that we had only twenty minutes
to wait.  We arrived at Crewe about one a.m. and
at one-thirty were in the train for Carlisle.
</p>

<p>
When we were near Carlisle the conductor
came to collect the tickets; I asked him if
Carlisle was the last stop.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  "From there we go on to
Glasgow without stopping."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," I said, "I didn't know that this train
went to Glasgow.  That's where we want to
go.  You had better make us out Excess Fare
checks and we'll go on."  He made them out,
I paid them and he went out through the
carriages.  During this time Captain Mellowes
was lying in the corner as if asleep.
</p>

<p>
In my list of "safe addresses" was one in
Glasgow.  When we arrived there next morning
we made our way to that address, and there
we stayed all day.  During the day we managed
to procure a clerical suit for Captain
Mellowes, complete even to the breviary and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
umbrella.  At eleven we took the train to
Ardrossan; from there we could get a boat to
Belfast.  We had decided before leaving the
house that we would travel as if we did not
know each other.  My accent was no longer
needed, as a strong Irish accent was quite the
thing for priests' clothing; but we were to keep
each other in sight all the time.
</p>

<p>
That Captain Mellowes really looked the
part was proved in the train.  The porter lifted
his cap to him, took his suitcase, and deferentially
placed him in the seat next to me.  There
Captain Mellowes sat, his chin resting on his
hands, which were supported by the umbrella,
as if lost in holy meditations.  Almost at the
last moment, half-a-dozen North of Ireland
cattle dealers tumbled into the carriage, shouting,
laughing, and swearing.  The porter had
locked the door and the train had started
before they realized what company they were in.
A sudden silence fell on them all, they straightened
themselves up, lifted their hats in salute
to the priest, while questioning each other with
their eyes.  Then one lifted his cap again and
turned to the rest as if to say, "I'm used to the
company of priests," and addressed Captain
Mellowes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Are you crossing to-night, Father?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I am," said Captain Mellowes.
</p>

<p>
"I hope we'll have a good night, Father."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so."
</p>

<p>
"I hear they caught a submarine up the
Bangor Lough this morning; but I don't think
there's any danger.  Do you, Father?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think so," said Captain Mellowes.
</p>

<p>
One dealer broke in then demanding to
know that if there was no danger, why could
they not insure the cattle they wanted to send
across.  Then each dealer tried to give his
opinion at the same time.  They became so
excited, each one trying to get an audience at the
same time, that they forgot all about the priest,
and gave back word for word to each other.
With raised voices they cursed and swore,
stamped their feet, pounded the floor with
their sticks, struck their hands, till one jumped
from his seat in a rage and his gaze fell on
the priest.  The priest was still resting his chin
on his hands, taking no more notice of them
than if they were miles away.  His very
abstraction was a rebuke to them.  The one who
had jumped up said humbly, "I'm afraid we've
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
disturbed you, Father."  Captain Mellowes
came to himself with a start.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, not at all," he said hurriedly.  "I
wasn't thinking of you at all."  But the men
looked as if they had offended beyond hope of
pardon and kept silent till we reached the boat.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning I went up on deck.  We
were steaming up the river, I could see the city
in the distance.  Nearer to me were the famous
Belfast shipyards, all alive with the clangor
of hammering.  As we approached I could see
the swarms of men, poised on derricks and
cranes, hard at work on the skeletons of ships.
Just before we docked Captain Mellowes came
on deck and walked over to the rail where I
was standing.  There was some byplay of
surprised recognition between us for the benefit
of those standing around.  I asked him to come
to the house for breakfast, and told him that
he could not get a train to Dublin before ten
o'clock.  It was then seven o'clock and the
gangplank was being put in place.  I told
Captain Mellowes that I was well known on
the docks since the dock strike, and that it
would be wiser for him to follow me instead of
coming with me; that he would probably pass
the Harbor Constables and policemen better
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
alone, because, as they knew me, they would be
likely to give my companion a scrutinizing
glance and he would be better without that.
</p>

<p>
There were two Harbor Constables and two
policemen at the end of the gangplank; they
were on the watch for deserters from the Army
and Navy.  When I walked down the gangplank
I saw that they recognized me and was
glad that I had told Captain Mellowes to
follow.  I went in to the shed and on towards
the exit.  Midway I paused, dropped my suitcase
as if to ease my arm, and glanced back to
see if Captain Mellowes was following.  He
was just at the end of the gangplank; the four
constables were saluting him and he was
gravely saluting them.
</p>

<p>
I passed out into the street and walked
slowly ahead to allow Captain Mellowes to catch
up on me.  In a short while we were walking
together.  It was too early to get a tram, and
it would attract too much attention if a car
drove up to our door, so we walked the
distance.  Falls Road, in Belfast, is called the
Nationalist district, and my home was near the
head of that road.  When we got to that part
of it where policemen were more plentiful and
I was better known, I told Captain Mellowes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
to walk on ahead.  I was glad I had done so,
for I derived a great deal of amusement from
the number of salutes Captain Mellowes had
to return.  Men and boys were on their way
to work and they all saluted him.  Every
policeman on the road saluted Captain
Mellowes; not one of them dreaming that the
capture of the young priest they were so courteous
to, would probably realize for him the dreams
of Sergeantship every young policeman indulges in.
</p>

<p>
It was with a sigh of relief that I ushered
Captain Mellowes into our house.  The door
was open and we entered without rapping.  My
mother thought we were the painters&mdash;she was
expecting them that morning&mdash;and came out
to remonstrate with us for not knocking.  She
was astounded for a moment, to see us in the
hall, then she threw her arms around us both
and literally dragged us both into the room
where breakfast was on the table.  She then
called up the stairs to my sisters and told them
we were home.  On the instant there was a
clatter and scamper, and pell-mell down the
stairs charged my young sisters, some partially
dressed and some in their nightgowns; bursting
into the room they flung themselves on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
Captain Mellowes, hugging and kissing him
as if he were a long lost brother returned.
They hung about him asking him questions,
interrupting each other.  They
poured forth so many questions that he
could not answer them much less eat his
breakfast.  Mother noticed that his breakfast was
growing cold and turning to the youngsters
said in a voice that tried to be severe,
"Children.  I'm surprised at you&mdash;look at your
clothes."  Then there was another rush to the
door and a scamper on the stairs as they raced
up to dress.  Never were they dressed so quickly
before, for in less time than it takes to tell
they were down again; crowding around the
table each giving the other in excitable voice
the story of how Captain Mellowes managed
to return; but none of them bothering to ask
Captain Mellowes or myself how it really happened.
</p>

<p>
Now that Captain Mellowes was in Belfast
the next thing to be done was to get him to
Dublin.  He could not go by train for there
were detectives at all the stations.  There have
always been detectives at railway stations in
Ireland, whose sole business is to watch and to
report the arrival and departure of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
important members of the Separatist Party (the
revolutionary body).  This method keeps the
local authorities informed as to the
whereabouts of "such and such a person."  On this
account I sought a friend who owned an
automobile.  It so happened that he was going to
Dublin that very evening and he agreed to
take Captain Mellowes with him.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived home again I saw a woman
in the parlor, who looked up at me through
her veil, in the most mournful way; certainly
the most forlorn person I had seen in a long
while.  But as I went nearer I recognized the
clothes.  My young sisters had decked Captain
Mellowes out in our clothes to see if they were
skillful at disguising.  They were&mdash;but the
clerical clothes were better.
</p>

<p>
I told Captain Mellowes of the arrangements
I had made&mdash;we were to walk into the
country along the Lisburn Road for about two
miles, and there meet the motor-car.  When it
was time we started out.  We were a party of
four, Captain Mellowes and another young
man, who was at that time hiding from the
police in our house, my sister Agna, and
myself.  We walked along the country road and
arrived at the appointed place too soon.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
car was a little late; every car that came along
would lift our hearts up and when it whizzed
by would leave us little more nervously
excited.  It came in the end, however, and
stopped for a minute while Captain Mellowes
was being bundled on to the car, then sped
away leaving us in the dark country road.
</p>

<p>
I arrived home about one-thirty and went to
bed, tired out and fully resolved to stay there
for the next day.  But, alas! the news had
got about and after school hours some of my
friends called to hear my version, and
compelled me to get up.  The day or so following
I took part in a Volunteer play called "Ireland
First" in order to give the impression that
I had been in Belfast and rehearsing with the
company.  On Saturday my mother received a
letter from my father; the only reference he
made to the job he had given me was, "Tell
Nora I am proud of her."
</p>

<p>
After that I was kept busy with the Ambulance
class, and in preparing field dressings
and bandages.  There were about fifty girls
working under my instructions and the work
was beginning to be piled up.  One squad was
cutting up the material, another wrapping it
up in waterproof material, others pasting on
the directions, others sewing the completed
bundle up in cotton bags which permitted them
to be sewn into the men's coats.  We were kept
busy.  When one of the officers came to the
room to order the field dressings for his men,
he voiced the opinion of all when he said,
"Well, this looks like business.  As soon as I
stepped inside the door I felt that something
important was going on.  I suppose you all
feel that way?"  We did, and worked all the
harder for it.
</p>

<p>
Some time before this my father had asked
me if I would be in Dublin with him during
the fight, but I had said, No, I would rather
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
stay with the Northern division; that I thought
I had better stay with the girls with whom I
had been working.  A younger sister had also
decided to join the Northern detachment.  My
mother and the rest of the family were going
to Dublin so as to be near my father.  We were
leaving the house just as it stood, to avoid
suspicion, taking nothing from it but the trunks
containing clothes.  These could easily be
taken without causing undue suspicion as it is
quite a usual thing for families to go away for
the Easter holidays.  Between helping to pack
up the trunks at home and the field dressings
outside I managed to secure six hours' sleep
during the latter part of Holy Week.  My
mother left Belfast on Good Friday, my sister
and I the following day.
</p>

<p>
The instructions given the First Aid corps
were: To meet at the Great Northern Station
with full equipment and two days' rations.
When we met the station was crowded with
holiday-goers.  There were three different
queues circled around the station.  We divided
ourselves amongst them so that our party
would not be large enough to attract attention.
I found myself behind a party of soldiers going
home on furlough.  I could not help wondering
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
if their furlough would be cut short, and
if I might meet them again under different
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
After I had taken the tickets I went to the
trains to see if it were possible to get a
carriage to ourselves.  As the party had been
split in two, one part to come on a later train,
we could just fill a carriage.  There was so
much traffic that the railroad company had
pulled out from many hiding places all the cars
they could find.  The line of cars presented a
very curious picture as it stood waiting for the
signal to start.  There were the very latest
corridor carriages, carriages quite new-looking,
carriages old, carriages very old, and carriages
so very old that they were an absolute temptation
to us.  These last were of that old type
that has no wall between the carriages; the
back of the seat is the only dividing wall.  We
picked out one and entered, took our seats,
stowed away our haversacks, water-bottles,
and hospital supplies under the seats and on
the racks over our heads.  Then we sat in
pleasant anticipation to see who would enter
the other carriage.  One of the girls had put
her head out of the window, and suddenly she
gave a whoop and waved her arms.  We hauled
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
her in angrily, demanding to know what she
meant by attracting attention in such a
manner&mdash;didn't she know that the fewer that saw us
the better?   "But," she said when she got a
chance, "I saw the Young Ireland Pipers
coming up the platform looking for a carriage,
and I thought it would be great to have them
in the next carriage.  They would pass the
time for us by playing the pipes."  (The
Young Ireland Pipers were attached to the
Volunteers.)
</p>

<p>
By this time the Pipers had come to the door
of the carriage next to us and were getting in.
They were both surprised and pleased when
they saw the girls.  They knew then that they
could play all the rebel songs they desired, and
say all the revolutionary things they could
think of.  That was one good thing about the
Republican forces in our part of the country&mdash;every
one knew every one else; and so it was
elsewhere I am told.  I doubt if ever pipers
were so dressed going to battle.  Slung from
one shoulder was a haversack, crossing it was
a bandolier filled with cartridges, a belt held
the haversack in its place on one side, and from
the other a bayonet was suspended.  Strapped
to the backs were rolled tar sheets, and under
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
their arms they held the bagpipes with their
green, white, and orange streamers flying over
their shoulders.  They were most warlike
musicians.  But more significant than all were
the eager eyes shining out from under their
caps.  One young chap leaned over the wall
and said to me, "My God!  Isn't it great?
We worked and worked without hope and
now&mdash;&mdash;"  One of the boys had been tuning
up the pipes and as the train began to move
we swung out of the station to the tune of:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Soldiers are we, whose lives are pledged to Ireland,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have come from the land beyond the wave,<br>
  Sworn to be free, no more our ancient sireland<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall shelter the despot or the slave.<br>
  To-night we man the Bearna Baoighail[*]<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Tyrone was our destination and we arrived
there before dark.  We were met by a local
committee and taken to a hotel.  After we had
something to eat, we went over to the drill hall.
There I had the first wound to attend to&mdash;one
of the men had accidentally shot himself while
cleaning his revolver.  There was quite a crowd
around me while I was dressing the wound.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
When I had finished, the men said that they
hoped I would be detailed with their company,
as they would feel much safer.  I said that I
didn't want to dress wounds till I had a chance
to make some: at this they laughed and promised
me that I would get all the chance I
wanted.  I then asked them when they would
mobilize.  "To-morrow morning," they replied.
"We are waiting for the Belfast Division
to arrive.  We start on our maneuvers at
12 o'clock.  We will all be together then."
</p>

<p>
We were still talking of our hopes when
some one came into the hall and said that he
had a message for Miss Connolly.  "Here I
am," I said.  "What do you want?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-088"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-088.jpg" alt="NORA CONNOLLY">
<br>
NORA CONNOLLY
</p>

<p>
"Come outside, Miss Connolly," said he.  "I
have a message for you."  I followed the man
outside.  The message he gave me was to the
effect that the Commandant in the North had
sent him to say that there would be no fighting
in the North; that he had received a demobilizing
order, but that he thought there would be
fighting in Dublin.  We could decide whether
we would go back to Belfast or on to Dublin.
He left the matter entirely in our own hands.
I left the messenger and went back to the hall
to call the girls together.  I asked them to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
come with me to the hotel.  I then told them
the text of the message I had received and
asked them to decide whether they would
return to Belfast or go to Dublin.  I said that
I was going to Dublin and they decided to go
with me.  One of the girls suggested that we
say the Rosary for the men who were about
to fight.  We knelt down and said it.  We then
began to get our things together again.  I
inquired about the trains to Dublin and was told
that there would be no train till midnight.  It
was almost 10 o'clock then and we were some
miles away from a station.  I asked one of the
men where I could get a car to take us to the
station.  They protested against our leaving,
but I said that we had our work to do, and
must get to Dublin as soon as possible.  After
some talk he sent one of the men to get two
cars for us.  We waited most impatiently till
they came, then piling on to them as best we
could we left the town and went towards the
station.
</p>

<p>
While we were waiting for the train we saw
the second contingent arriving from Belfast.
The men had their equipment with them and
swung out of the station in a truly martial
way.  I knew from their joyous faces and their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
remarks that they had not received the news we
had, and I pictured to myself the change there
would be when they did.
</p>

<p>
Our train left Tyrone at twelve-thirty, and
arrived in Dublin at five-fifteen.  We went
directly to Liberty Hall for I knew my father
would be there.  Ever since the attempted raid
on Liberty Hall, he had stayed there every
night under an armed guard.  He had determined
that he would not be arrested before the
day arrived.
</p>

<p>
As we approached to the building we saw
an armed sentry keeping watch through a
window; we went up the steps and knocked on
the door.  A sentry came to the door and asked
our business.  I said I was Mr. Connolly's
daughter and that the girls were ambulance
workers from the North.  He did not know
me, so he called to some one else to decide for
him.  The man he called to was the officer of
the guard who knew me.  As we went inside
the door and up the stairs I asked him if he
thought I could see my father.  He told me
that my father had not been able to go to bed
until three o'clock.  I said I thought it best to
see my father at once.  He then escorted me
to the corridor in which my father's room was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
and told me the number.  I walked along the
corridor till I found the room and knocked on
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" called my father.
</p>

<p>
"Nora," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?  I thought you
were with the North men."
</p>

<p>
"Let me in, father," I said.  "I am afraid
there is something wrong."
</p>

<p>
He opened the door and I entered the room.
It was rather a small room, square and slightly
furnished.  There were but two chairs, a table,
a cupboard and an army cot.  My father was
lying on the cot and looking at me in surprise.
I went over to him and knelt down beside the
cot to tell him why I was there.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean, father?  Are we not
going to fight?" I asked him when I had finished.
</p>

<p>
"Not fight!" he said in amazement.  "Nora,
if we don't fight now, we are disgraced forever;
and all we'll have left to hope and pray;
for will be, that an earthquake may come and
swallow Ireland up."
</p>

<p>
"Then why were we told last night that there
would be no fighting in the North?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
</p>

<p>
"We received word last night that there
could not be got fifty men to leave Belfast."
</p>

<p>
"That is not true!" I cried.  "Why, there
were fifty men on the train with us leaving
Belfast; and before we left Tyrone there were
two hundred.  I saw them myself.  They are
there now with all their equipment, eager and
happy and boisterous with delight."
</p>

<p>
"That is a different story from what we were
told," said my father.
</p>

<p>
"Mine is the true one," I returned.  "But
don't accept my word for it.  Call in the other
girls and question them."
</p>

<p>
"Ask them to come in."
</p>

<p>
I went out to the girls and said that my
father would like to see them.  They came in;
they all knew my father but he did not know
them all, so I told him all their names.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, girls," said my father, "how many
men you saw in Tyrone before you left,
Belfast men particularly."
</p>

<p>
Their story was practically the same as mine.
When he had heard them all, my father asked
one of them to call in the guard who was on
duty in the corridor.  When the guard had
entered the room, or rather stood at the door,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
my father said to him, "Call the officer of the
guard."
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards the officer of the guard
knocked on the door.  I opened the door and
he came inside, saluted and said, "Yes, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Send in five men who know the city thoroughly,"
said my father.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the officer as he saluted again.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said my father turning to us again.
"I am going to send you to each of the other
Commandants.  You tell them just what you
have told me.  And after you tell them all,
ask them to come here as quickly as they can."
</p>

<p>
The five Citizen Army men came to the
room shortly after that, and each of the girls
was given different addresses to go to.  It fell
to my lot to go to Sean MacDermott.  I had
as my guide a man who looked as little an
Irishman as he well might be.  He was short
and stout yet very light on his feet; he wore
bright blue overalls, short black leggings, and
his face was burnt a dark brown.  He wore a
wide black felt hat and from under it I saw
hanging from his ears, big, round gold
ear-rings.  He looked as I fancied a Neapolitan
fisherman would look like.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
</p>

<p>
The leaders slept no two nights in the same
place.  Only themselves knew where each other
was sleeping.  This was for safety.  I was
taken to a place beyond Parnell Square, about
twenty minutes walk from the Hall.  When
we arrived there we had to knock the people
up; and it was some time before we received
any answer.  They were very suspicious of us
when I said who it was I wanted.  The woman,
who opened the door, consulted with some one
inside the house, before she decided to let me
in.  The guide having done his duty in bringing
me there and seeing that I was about to
enter the house, went back to Liberty Hall to
report.
</p>

<p>
The woman then asked me who I was, what
did I want, wouldn't any one else do, and a
score of other questions.  She went away after
she had received my answers.  In a few
minutes a young man came down to interview me
also.  I told him that I was Mr. Connolly's
daughter and that Sean MacDermott knew
me, and that I had a message for him from my
father.  He was still reluctant to let me see
Sean and said that Sean had hardly had time
to go to sleep.  I said that I knew that but
that I had been traveling all night from the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
North, and had wakened my father over an
hour ago who had had even less sleep than Sean.
</p>

<p>
After that he went away and came back to
say that I could see Sean MacDermott.  I
went upstairs and found him in bed.  He was
looking very pale and tired.  He listened to
me, while I told him all I had to tell, without
saying a word till I had finished.  He then
asked me if the others knew this.  I told him
that there were other girls seeing the other
leaders at the same time.  He remained silent
for a while and then said, "I am very glad
you came.  Tell your father that I'll be at the
Hall as soon as I can."  I then returned to
Liberty Hall.  It was then about seven
o'clock and we decided to go to Mass at
Marlborough Cathedral around the corner.
</p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
When we returned from Mass my father
had risen, and dressed in his uniform was going
about the room singing to himself:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "We've got another savior now,<br>
  That savior is the sword."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I began to prepare breakfast for my father
and the rest of us.  But it was some time
before we sat down to our breakfast, as one by
one the leaders dropped into the room, and as
none of them had waited to have breakfast
before coming they had to be served.  I remember
giving breakfast to a young officer who had
come up on the night mail from Limerick, for
final instructions.  I gave Tom Clarke his
last Easter breakfast.  It seemed fitting he
should have as table companion Sean
MacDermott&mdash;they were always such close friends.
Before they had finished Joseph Plunkett, his
throat heavily swathed in bandages, for he had
shortly gone under an operation, arrived; and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
following him closely came Thomas MacDonagh.
Michael Mallin and my father had their
breakfast together.  They were all in uniform,
except Tom Clarke and Sean MacDermott.
Pearse did not have his breakfast at Liberty
Hall; he arrived somewhat later than the
others and had already eaten.  While they were
all standing around and talking, one of the
girls came in and said, "Mr. Connolly, look,
the <i>Independent</i> says, 'No maneuvers
to-day.'  What does that mean?  Is it a trick?"
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" said my father, taking the
paper from her.  "Maneuvers" was the name
under which our men were being mobilized.  If
the <i>Independent</i>, which had the largest
circulation of any Sunday paper throughout the
country, printed such a bit of news it would
disorganize our forces to a great extent.  Yet,
there it was:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Owing to the critical situation all Volunteer parades
and maneuvers are canceled.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  By order<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eoin MacNeill.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What does this mean?" asked my father,
turning to Pearse.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see it," said Pearse.  "I know nothing
whatsoever about this," he said when he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
had read it.  After that there was some
low-voiced conversation among the leaders; and
then the Council room.  They remained there
till after one o'clock.
</p>

<p>
We then ate our long delayed breakfasts
and then went to another part of the Hall to
see more stirring sights.  On our way out of
the corridor we had to pass the Council room.
It was guarded by an armed sentry who stood
at the door forbidding all to pass.  He stopped
us and would not allow us to pass until one
of the officers coming out of the room saw our
plight and told him who we were.  When we
came to the corner of the corridor we were
again stopped by a sentry, but he knew me
and we went on out to the front of the building.
</p>

<p>
Here, all was excitement, guards at the top
and the bottom of the stairs, men and boys,
women and girls running up and down; Citizen
Army men arriving by the dozen armed
with all their equipment, poured steadily into
the great front hall.
</p>

<p>
We remained about the Hall as we had been
told to stay within call in case we were needed
as messengers to the North.  We remained in
the vicinity until well on in the afternoon.  It
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
was not until the Citizen Army started out on
a march that we were freed.  I have never
been able to understand how it was that the
authorities did not become aware that
something untoward was afoot.  There were
two dozen policemen detailed to attend the
Citizen Army march and they hung around
Beresford Place waiting for the march to
begin.  Surely they should have been able to
sense the difference in the feeling of the crowds
that were thronged around Liberty Hall all
the day.  There was no disguising by the
people that they expected a different ending to
this march than to all the other marches.  Else
why the haversacks filled with food, the
bandoliers filled with ammunition, and the supply
wagons piled high with supplies?  The men
and women were under military orders.  They
were no longer a volunteer organization, they
were a nation's army.  Their fathers and,
mothers, their wives and children, their sisters
and brothers, and their sweethearts knew that
from that day forth their lives were no longer
their own, but belonged to Ireland.  And while
they openly exulted in this thought and
brought parting gifts to their loved ones, the
police saw nothing.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span></p>

<p>
Before they went on their march my father
called me to him and told me to bring the girls
to Surrey House, the home of the Countess de
Markievicz, so that they would have a rest
before reporting at Liberty Hall the following
morning.  They badly needed rest as they had
had no sleep the night before.  Our orders were
to report at Liberty Hall the next morning at
eight o'clock.
</p>

<p>
The next morning when we reached Liberty
Hall we were told that we were to be given
a message to take back North with us.  The
message was to be written and signed by
Padraic Pearse; therefore we had to wait until he
came.  While we were waiting Thomas MacDonagh
came into the room.  He was in uniform.
He greeted us in his gay, kindly way
and pretended to jeer at us for leaving the
city.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are," he said, "on the brink of a
revolution and all you are thinking of is to get
out of the city before we begin."
</p>

<p>
While he was talking my father came into
the room carrying a large poster.  He unrolled
it and spread it out on the table saying, "Come
here, girls, and read this carefully.  It would
be too dangerous to allow you to carry it with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
you, but read it carefully and tell the men in
the North of what you have read."  We all
gathered around the table and read The
Proclamation of the Irish Republic.  I think that
we had the honor of being amongst the first to
see the proclamation.
</p>

<p>
Pearse came in while we were discussing our
intended journey.  He was in uniform; his
military overcoat making him look taller and
broader than ever.  My father told him that
we were waiting for the message.  He went
to the Council room to write it and we followed
him.  While we were waiting my father gave
me some advice as to what we should do when
we arrived in the North.  Then Pearse called
to us and we went to him.  He handed me an
envelope and said, "May God bless you all and
the brave men of the North."  He said it so
solemnly and so earnestly that I felt as if I had
been at Benediction.  I then said "Good-by"
to my father and left the Hall to take the nine
o'clock train to the North.

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
We knew that the men were to rise at twelve
o'clock and as that hour drew nigh we watched
and listened anxiously to hear or see if the
news had reached the North before us.  At
twelve o'clock we left the train at Portadown.
There was a large body of men belonging to
an Orange Band parading up and down the
platform beating their drums.  They were
going to some meeting in Derry.  The noise was
terrific but we bore it gladly for it told more
than words that our men in Dublin had been
able to carry out their plans without any
untoward accident.  We changed into the other
train and finished our journey in a less anxious
frame of mind.  But there was disappointment
awaiting us at Tyrone; when we arrived there
the men had already received the demobilizing
order of MacNeill and had obeyed it.  The
Belfast contingent was already in Belfast and
the country divisions had not had time to
mobilize before the order from MacNeill had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
arrived.  When I found this out I sent
messengers to the various bodies advising them of
what was going on in Dublin.  The principal
dispatch was the one given us by Pearse and
that one was sent off in care of my sister, other
girls going to other places.  There was nothing
for the rest of us to do but to await the
return of the messengers.
</p>

<p>
At eight o'clock that night a boy came from
Belfast who said that he had been sent to
advise us to return to Belfast and asked us to
go back with him.  I asked the officer of the
local Volunteer Corps if they intended to go
on with the fight now that the men in Dublin
were out, or if they intended to obey
MacNeill's order.  He replied that they were in
honor bound to assist the Dublin men.  I said
that being the case I would remain with them
and that we would attach ourselves to their
body as they had no First Aid Corps.
</p>

<p>
About an hour later the local organizer came
to the hotel and asked for me.  I went out to
him; he said that it would be better if we were
in a less conspicuous place&mdash;would we go to
some place out in the country?  It was nearer
to the meeting place.  We agreed to go and
started out about ten o'clock.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was a night of pitch darkness, a heavy
rain was pouring steadily.  After a ten minutes'
walk we were out on a country road where
the darkness seemed to grow thicker with every
step.  We could see nothing but trusting to
our guides soughed up and down in the mud.
For twenty minutes we walked on, then we
were told to turn to the right.  We could see
nothing that showed a turning, still we turned
and found that we were in a narrower road
than before.  It was even muddier than the
road we had left but it was shorter.  At the
end we were stopped by a door of what
appeared to be a barn.  One of the men rapped
on it and it was opened to us.  We stepped
inside and when our eyes were used to the light
again, saw a number of men with their rifles.
The hall was filled with standing men, a place
was cleared around the hearth upon which was
blazing the biggest turf fire I had ever seen.
On a bench near the fire were a half dozen
women; they had brought food to the men and
were now waiting to take the girls home with
them.  After a short wait we started out again,
still following blindly where we were led.  At
length we came to a crossroads and there the
party divided.  I, along with some other girls,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
was taken to a large farmhouse where the folk
were waiting up for us.  We went into a large
kitchen and sat around a big turf fire.  There
was porridge, in a pot hanging over the fire
from a long hook, for those who liked it; and
the kettle was boiling for those who preferred
tea.  We had a long talk around the fire.  The
old man told us of his experiences when he was
a Fenian and drew comparisons between that
time and this.  Our time was nothing like
his&mdash;so he told us.
</p>

<p>
In the morning we rose early; we expected to
have word from Belfast every minute telling
us to get on the march.  But no word came that
day.  As the hours passed my anxiety became
unbearable.  I had had no word from anybody
since I had come there.  The men and the boys
could not work for fear the word would come
when they were in the fields and might be
delayed if they were not on hand.  And all the
day long they were riding up and down the
roads on the watch for the messenger who
would give them the orders to rise.  The
second day passed, still the word never came.  The
men and boys came to us every hour to
report all they knew.  And on Wednesday at
noon a man burst into the farmhouse crying,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
"Pack up in the name of God, the word has
come!"  With what joy we packed up.  How
quickly the water bottles were filled and the
haversacks stuffed with food.  Butter, eggs,
bread, and milk were thrust upon us.  We
could not take enough to satisfy the good
people.  The place was full of bustle and
excitement, and then&mdash;the order was rescinded; it
was a false alarm.
</p>

<p>
That disappointment ended my patience.  I
determined to go after my sister, who had not
returned since she had left me to deliver the
dispatch written by Pearse; and when we were
together again we would both start for Dublin.
I told the girls that I did not think that there
would be any need of us in the North, that
the men in command were waiting too long.
That being the case it would be better for
them to go home to Belfast and Agna and
I would go to Dublin.  They did not want to
go from me, but I said I was speaking to them
as their officer and they should obey.  After a
good deal of explaining they agreed to go
home the next day.
</p>

<p>
I found that if I wanted to go to the town
where my sister had gone, I would need to go
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
by car.  So a car was hired for me the next
day.  Just before the hour set for them to
leave, a brother of one of the girls came to
see what had happened to them.  They all
went home together.  The car for myself came
a little later and in it I piled as many of the
Ambulance supplies as I could.  There was
only room for myself in the back, most of the
room being taken up with the bundles.  We
started on our journey about six o'clock.
</p>

<p>
The town to which my sister had taken the
dispatch was called Gortin; but later I had
heard that she was at Carrickmore, since when
I had not had any news of her.  Before my
mother had left Belfast she had entrusted
Agna to my care, therefore I felt that I could
not return without her.  While on my way to
Carrickmore to see if she was still there I had
to pass through a village whose streets were
thronged with soldiers.  As we went out of
the village and on into the country we met at
least half a dozen motor trucks filled with
soldiers.  There were more marching behind, so
many in fact that I asked the driver if there
was a training camp near here.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  "There is not.  I'm afraid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
those fellows spell trouble."  Conscious that
the soldiers were looking sharply at myself and
the bundles, I felt more than relieved when the
car spun on out of their sight.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
It was about eight o'clock when we reached
the farm at Carrickmore.  Fortunately the
man to whom my sister had carried the
dispatch was there.  As I was telling him who
I was and why I had come, his sister broke on
me and exclaimed sharply:
</p>

<p>
"My God!  Why did you come here?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," I asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Did you not meet the soldiers on your way
here?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, I did.  I saw lots of them.  What
are they doing here?" I asked, turning to her
brother.
</p>

<p>
"They raided this place this afternoon," he
said, "and have only left here three-quarters of
an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
"Raided the place!" I cried.  "But, of course,
they found nothing."
</p>

<p>
"They did, though," he said.  "They found
three thousand rounds of ammunition."
</p>

<p>
"Three thousand rounds!" I cried amazed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
and angry.  "Where did you have it hidden?"
</p>

<p>
"In the turf stack," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"In the turf stack!  Good God!  What made
you put it there?  Doesn't every one who isn't
a fool know that that would be one of the first
places they would look for it.  Three thousand
rounds of ammunition in a turf stack!  Couldn't
you have hidden it some place else?  Couldn't
you have divided it?  Couldn't you have&mdash;&mdash;"
and I broke off almost crying with anger and
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I know, Miss Connolly, you can't say or
think anything more of the loss than I do.  But
I haven't been able to look after things this
past week.  I'm in hiding, chasing from pillar
to post trying to find out what is to be done."
</p>

<p>
"And what are you going to do?" I asked.
"This is Thursday and the men have been
fighting in Dublin since Monday noon.  What are
you going to do?  Think of the numbers of
men and boys, women and girls who are at this
minute in Dublin offering up their lives while
the men of the North are doing nothing.
It's a shame!  It's a disgrace!"
</p>

<p>
"What could we have done?  The men were
all dispersed when I received the last dispatch.
It's a different thing to mobilize men in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
country from what it is in the city.  There
are a dozen or so here; six miles off there is
a score; ten miles off there are some more, and
so it goes all over the country.  What were we
to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Weren't you in a terrible hurry to obey
MacNeill's order?  Why were the men chased
home on Sunday night and Monday morning?
They were all gone when we arrived at
Coalisland on Monday at one o'clock.  Why were
you in such a hurry to demobilize the men when
their Easter holidays lasted till Tuesday?  Did
you not want them to fight?  Were you afraid
that another order would come rescinding
MacNeill's?" The questions poured from me
breathlessly; I was emptying my mind of all
the riddles and puzzles that had been tormenting it.
</p>

<p>
"Say what you like, Miss Connolly, what
can I say?"  And he spread his hands in a
helpless gesture.
</p>

<p>
"It's a shame," I commenced again.  "Why
did you not tell the men and give them the
option of going on to Dublin?  Why were the
girls so honored?  Why, the North can never
lift up its head again.  The men in Dublin
preparing to lay down their lives while the North
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
men were being chased home by their
commanders.  It's awful!"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Connolly, can't you believe that I feel
it as much as you do?  Think what it means to
me that the men in Dublin are being killed
while we are here doing nothing."
</p>

<p>
"The men in Dublin are fighting for
Ireland.  In a short while you may be fighting
up here&mdash;and why?  Because the Ulster
Division is already quartered in Dungannon
and Coalisland, and are trying to provoke a
party riot by parading the streets in numbers,
crying 'To Hell with the Pope.'  There are
bunches of them sitting on the doorsteps of
Catholic houses singing 'Dolly's Brae' (the
worst of all their songs).  And if they go
beyond bounds and those Catholics lose their
temper, it will be in the power of England to
say that while one part of the country was in
rebellion, another part was occupied in
religious fights.  If you had issued another
mobilization order when you received the dispatch
from Pearse, that could never happen.  Why
didn't you issue that order?"
</p>

<p>
"We were waiting, Miss Connolly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You were waiting.  What for?" I broke
in.  "And now you have waited too long.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
There has been a flying column sent from
Belfast, some two hundred strong, and it has
taken up such positions that you are prevented
from coming together.  Dungannon, Coalisland,
and all around there is completely cut
off from this part.  There is nothing now for
the North men to do but sit tight and pray
to God that the Dublin men will free their
country for them.  My God!  A manly part!
Where is my sister?  I want to get her and go
on to Dublin.  I would be ashamed to stay
here while the people in Dublin are fighting."
</p>

<p>
"She took a dispatch to Clogher and is still there."
</p>

<p>
"Is Clogher far from here?  Can I get there,
to-night?" I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"No, you cannot get there to-night; it is too
far away.  It is over the mountains.  Stay
here the night and you can set out in the
morning.  Stay here as long as you like, make
this place your home, and don't be too hard
on the North.  We acted as we thought best,
and perhaps we are sorry for it now.  It is
MacNeill's order that must be blamed.  Good
night, Miss Connolly."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going out?  Do you not stop
here?" I asked as I saw him gathering up his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
raincoat and cap.  He straightened up his tall
figure.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied.  "I have not slept here
since Monday.  I am determined that I shall
not be arrested without doing something
worth while.  Good night again, and remember
that this is your home for as long as you
wish to stay."
</p>

<p>
"Good night," I answered as he left the
room.  Then it seemed that all the hopelessness
of the world descended on me as I thought
that here was another day gone, and I had not
been able to accomplish anything.
</p>

<p>
I left the room in a few minutes and entered
the kitchen.  One side of the large farm
kitchen was taken up by a fireplace.  A large
pot that was suspended over a huge turf fire
the light of which reached across the room and
danced and glistened upon the dishes that were
standing on the top rack of the dresser.  It
was a sparsely furnished kitchen, for besides
the dresser I could see only a table placed
under the window, some farm implements on the
other side of the room, and some benches.
Except for the blazing of the fire there was no
light, and while the ceiling was a roof of ruddy
light, the rest of the kitchen was kept in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
semi-darkness by the farm laborers, who were sitting
round the fire.  The first thing I did was to
arrange and make tidy my bundles of bandages
which had been carried into the kitchen
by the driver of the car.  As I straightened up,
my glance fell upon one of the men sitting by
the fire, whom to my surprise I recognized as
Lieutenant Hoskins of the Belfast Volunteers.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Rory," I exclaimed.  "What are you
doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" he asked.  "I
thought you were in Dublin.  Didn't you go
there Saturday night?"
</p>

<p>
"I did," I answered.  "But I came North
with a dispatch on Monday.  I intend to go
to Dublin to-morrow.  But you didn't say
what you are doing here."
</p>

<p>
"There was more chance of something happening
here&mdash;we could do nothing in Belfast."
</p>

<p>
"There will be nothing happening here," I
said.  "That's why I am going to Dublin."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I'll try and make my way there
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I'd advise you to," I said as I left the
kitchen.  I was shown to my room and lost no
time in getting to bed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
</p>

<p>
When my sister was leaving with the
dispatch, I took her haversack from her so that
she would not attract any unnecessary attention.
That I might look like an ordinary traveler
I put her haversack along with mine in
a suitcase, and that suitcase had been carried
to my room.  The events of the night proved
that it was a lucky thing for me that it had
been brought to the bedroom.  As I looked at
it I wondered if a suitcase had ever before
been packed in a like manner.
</p>

<p>
I could not have been asleep fifteen minutes
when I was awakened by a tremendous rapping.
In a few seconds the girl came to my room.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Connolly," she said.  "What will we
do?  They are here again."  I instantly
thought of my revolver and cartridges which
I had carried with me.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," I said.  "Put on my coat and go
down and open the door before they get angry."
</p>

<p>
"Why should I put on your coat?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because I have something in it that I do
not wish them to see.  Put it on," I said, "and
hurry down to the door."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
</p>

<p>
When she had the coat on she went to one
of the windows and opened it.  She put her
head out and asked who was there.  While
she was parleying with the soldiers I
remembered that I had one hundred rounds of
ammunition in one of the haversacks wrapped up in
some clothing.  I jumped out of bed and
opened the suitcase.  I had to rummage
because I dare not make a light.  I pulled article
after article out of one of the haversacks in
hot haste, but it was not there.
</p>

<p>
I turned to the other one and began searching
it.  I had just felt it when I heard a step
on the stairs.  Grasping it in my hand I
sprung back into the bed.  I had only
arranged myself and was lying down when a
light was flashed in my face.
</p>

<p>
The light was so strong that I could only
lie there and blink my eyes.  In a few minutes
the light was removed from my face and
flashed about the room, enabling me to see
that it was held by a District Inspector of
Police, and that he was accompanied by a
military officer and some of the Royal Irish
Constabulary.  The D.I. switched the light
back on my face suddenly and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Are you only waking up?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Just now," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid," he said.  "We heard that
some more stuff came to this house to-day
and we have come for it."
</p>

<p>
"It's not the most reassuring thing in the
world to have soldiers and police come into
your room at this time of night," I returned.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name?" he asked.  I told
him.  I did not give a false one, as I did not
know whether he had asked the girl downstairs
my name or not.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you from?" was his next question.
</p>

<p>
"Belfast," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Is that your suitcase?" he asked, pointing to it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Look in it," he said to the officer.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing there but my personal
property," I said.
</p>

<p>
"All the same we must look," the D.I. said
to me, as he went down to his knees beside the
officer.
</p>

</p>

<p>
They gave it a rather cursory examination.
Then they opened the wardrobe and looked
into it, glanced into the drawers of the bureau.
My heart almost stopped beating when they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
came near the bed.  What should I do if they
told me to rise?  But they only looked under
it, and passed out into the sitting room
adjoining my bedroom.  After they had examined
the room they went downstairs again.  I could
hardly believe my luck.  I was silently
congratulating myself when I heard their heavy
steps on the stairs again.
</p>

<p>
They came into the room again.  The D.I. said,
as he poured the rays of his lamp on my
face, "We have found something downstairs
which made us come up here to look again."  I
did not say anything in reply, only lay there
and wondered to myself if they had found the
revolver on the girl and if she had told them
to whom it belonged.  The military man was
down on his knees at my suitcase once more.
</p>

<p>
"Did you say that there was nothing here but
your personal property?" asked the D.I. as
he knelt down beside him.
</p>

<p>
And then began the second search of my
suitcase.  Very carefully he lifted out each
article and examined it.  The stockings were
turned inside out as a woman turns them when
looking for holes.  The reason for such an act
I do not know, save that they might have
thought that I had a dispatch concealed in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
them.  The very fact that I knew that there
was nothing incriminating in the suitcase made
me lie back in the bed unconcernedly.  Suddenly
the officer said, "Ah!" and passed something
to the District Inspector.  As they were
between me and the suitcase I could not see
what it was.  The District Inspector turned
his head over his shoulder and asked again,
"Did you say that there was nothing here but
your own personal property?"
</p>

<p>
"I did," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you call this?" he asked,
holding up two bundles wrapped in blue paper.
"Do you call these personal property?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, they are," I said, seeking hurriedly in
my mind for an explanation.  The parcel he was
holding up for me to see held two dozen roller
bandages.  "They're mine," I said with sudden
inspiration, "I got them cheap at a sale."
</p>

<p>
The answer evidently tickled the two men,
for they laughed and one said to the other,
"Just like a woman."  They next came upon
a box of tea, sugar, and milk tablets.  The
District Inspector asked as he held it up, "Are
you going to start a commissariat department
with these?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered.  "They are no good."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
</p>

<p>
Having completely overhauled my suitcase
they next directed their attention to the
bureau drawers.  Every piece of paper in the
drawers, letters, bills, etc., were read, and even
the pages of books were turned over to make
sure that nothing escaped them.  They looked
under the bed again and then passed out to
the sitting room, where they remained but a few
minutes.  Shortly afterwards they went downstairs
and then I heard them going out through
the door.
</p>

<p>
Hardly were they out of the house when the
girl came running to my room.  "Get up, Miss
Connolly," she said.  "Get up and go.  They'll
come back and arrest you.  Get up."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," I said.  "If they intended to
arrest me they would have done it now and not
wait till they came back.  You're excited, but
there is no danger."
</p>

<p>
"You've just got to go, Miss Connolly," she
said.  "You can't stay here."
</p>

<p>
"That's all very well," I said.  "But don't
you know that I am a stranger round these

<h3>
XI
</h3>

<p>
I was down in the kitchen before six o'clock.
The girl had put some bread and butter on the
table, a cup of tea and an egg.  My heart
was so full I could not eat but I managed to
drink the tea.  I then turned to the place where
I had stacked my bundles of bandages the
night before.  They were gone, even the
knapsack that held my few days' rations.
</p>

<p>
"Where are all my things gone to?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The soldiers took them away last night."
</p>

<p>
"When?" I asked.  "How did they come to see them?"
</p>

<p>
"After they came down from your room the
first time," she replied.  "They asked me who
owned those bundles.  I said the girl upstairs.
Then they examined them, called in the soldiers
and told them to take those bundles."
</p>

<p>
"Did they take the haversack with my rations?"
</p>

<p>
"They took everything.  And they asked me
the name of the girl upstairs.  And I said I
didn't know; that you came last night and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
asked for a night's lodging, and that I never
turned any one away from the door."
</p>

<p>
"You told them that!" I cried.  "Did you
want to make them suspect me?  Do you
usually give your guest room to women
tramps?  In the name of Heaven, how could
you be so foolish?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said.  "I wasn't going to let
on that I knew you."
</p>

<p>
"What will I do?" I said.  "Now they will
be on the watch for me.  I can't go to Clogher
by train.  I'll have to walk.  How far is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's not five miles," she answered.  "You
can walk it easily.  About two miles from it
you will come to a place called Ballygawley,
and there you can get a tram that will take you
to Clogher."
</p>

<p>
"Five miles," I said.  "I'll get there easily
before noon.  Which way do I go?"
</p>

<p>
Before she answered a woman came in with
a message from the girl's brother.  She looked
at me suspiciously till she was told who I was.
I told her that I was going to walk to Clogher
to get my sister who was there, and that after
that we would make our way to Dublin.
</p>

<p>
"To Clogher!" she said and looked at me in
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.  "Does your road go near
Ballygawley?  If so, I'll go with you and you
can point it out to me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered.  "But&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But I was already on my way to get the
suitcase and did not wait to listen to her
objections.  As I came down again I heard the girl
say:
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;that's what I'd like to know."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said.  "What I'd like to know is
who the girls were who brought the message
to Dublin from Tyrone.  There were two, I
know; one was redhaired but it was the other
delivered the message by word of mouth.  I'd
like to know who she is."
</p>

<p>
"I brought the message," said the girl who
belonged to the house.
</p>

<p>
"You brought the message," I said and
stared at her.  "YOU&mdash;did you know that it
was a wrong one?  Don't you know that you
reported a false state of affairs?  How could
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well enough," she answered.  "You've
ruined this farm with your capers.  The men
are unsettled, my two brothers are in hiding,
and not a thing being done on the farm."
</p>

<p>
"Farm," I repeated and turned to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
visitor.  I saw her blush for her acquaintance
with the woman who had no soul but for a farm.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said the visitor to me.  "I'll show
you the road."  And without another word we
left.  We went silently on our way.  We
crossed fields which brought us out on to a
road, along which we walked for about ten
minutes till we came to a branching of it.
"We'll go up here," said my guide.  I saw
that it was a kind of boreen leading up to a
very small farm cottage.  As soon as we
entered the woman turned to me and said,
"We're not all like that"&mdash;not saying who or
what she meant.  Then again she said, "It's
our shame and disgrace that our men are not
helping the men in Dublin."  A young man
had risen from his seat when we entered.  She
next spoke to him and gave him a message.
"It's for him," she said, nodding her head in
the direction we had come from.
</p>

<p>
As she pointed to me she said to the young
man, "She's going to walk to Clogher."
</p>

<p>
"To Clogher," he repeated.  "It's a long walk."
</p>

<p>
"I've the day before me," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've got my message to deliver or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
I'd go part of the way with you.  It wouldn't
be so long or lonely if you had company."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I said.  "But I'll get along all right."
</p>

<p>
"Can I do anything for you before you
start?" asked the woman when he was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.  "You can give me a drink of water."
</p>

<p>
"Water!" she exclaimed.  "Water!  Indeed
you'll get no water from me!  You'll just take
a long drink of milk.  You'll need some
nourishment to bring you over the long walk that's
before you."  With that she handed me a huge
bowl of milk.  She stood by me till I finished
it, then she asked me if I had anything with
me to eat in case I got hungry on the way.
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied.  "The D.I. and his men
took away the bag containing my rations."
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, "you've got to have
something."  She commenced to butter some biscuits.
</p>

<p>
"Don't bother," I said to her.  "I'll get
along all right without that.  I'll be in Clogher
about twelve."
</p>

<p>
"O, you will," she said.  "Well, just take
these in case you don't.  And I don't think you
will."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
</p>

<p>
I took the biscuits, then lifted up my
suitcase and started to leave the house.  "Wait
a minute," she cried.  She went into a room
and returned with a Holy Water bottle.  She
sprinkled me with it and said, "May God bless
and look after you, and bring you safely to
your journey's end."
</p>

<p>
She then pointed out the road to me and I
began my walk to Clogher.  The road lay
between low, flat-lying lands for the better part
of two miles.  There was neither hedge nor
ditch dividing the fields from the road; nor
were there any trees for shade.  It was a most
lonely road; I walked on for hours and never
met a soul.  The sun was roasting hot that day,
and I was heavily laden.  Besides the suitcase
containing the two kits which I was carrying,
I was wearing a tweed skirt and a raincoat
over my uniform.  As I walked, the fields on
one side of the road changed and in their place
were bogs.  An intolerable thirst grew upon
me and there was nothing with which to slake it.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the road became a mountain road.
Had I not been so tired, what with the weight
of the suitcases and the clothes I was wearing
and the broiling sun, I could have admired
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
the quiet, shadeless road that stretched along
for miles trimming the skirt of the mountains.
The mountains sloped away so gently from
the road as to seem no more than hills.
Patches of olive green and brown edged with
a brighter green rose one above the other, each
one more pleasing.  Here and there the trimming
was the golden furze or whin bushes; and
on towards the top patches of purple and blue
told of the presence of wild hyacinths.  And
above all was the pure blue and white of the
sky.  Below, the mountains, on the left of the
road stretched the bog as far as I could see,
brown, brown, browner, and finally black.
Here and there, standing cut sharply against
the dark background, danced the ceanawan&mdash;the
bogrose&mdash;disputing for place with the
ever-present furze.  Yet all I could think of was
that I must walk for miles on that lonely
country road, with never a tree for shade and never
a house to get a drink in.
</p>

<p>
I knew by the height of the sun that it was
nearly twelve o'clock, yet I had not come to
Ballygawley.  In terror I thought for an
instant that I had taken the wrong road, and
then I remembered that the woman had told
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
me that there was only the one road until I
came to Sixmilecross.
</p>

<p>
At a distance from me and walking towards
me I saw an old man.  I tried to hurry
towards him but could not.  With every step
the suitcase was growing heavier and my hands
were becoming so sore that to hold the handle
was absolute pain.  And my thirst was growing.
I could not understand how it was that
I had not met with running water, it is usually
so plentiful in Ireland.  Finally my thirst
grew so clamorous that I knelt down by the
bog, lifted some of the brackish, stagnant
bog-water in my hands and drank it.  Immediately
I began to think, "What if I contract some
illness from drinking that water&mdash;what if I get
fever&mdash;&mdash;"  And I had visions of being taken
ill by the roadside with no one to look after me.
Rut the old man was very near me now, and
as we came abreast I asked him, "Am I near
Ballygawley?"
</p>

<p>
"Ballygawley," he replied.  "Daughter dear,
you are six weary long miles from Ballygawley."
</p>

<p>
"Six miles!" I thought in despair.  "How
had the girl made such a mistake?"
</p>

<p>
I stumbled on till I was completely worn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
out and not able to go more than a few yards
at a time.  And then, while I sat by the roadside
feeling that I could not rise again, I saw
two girls coming towards me on bicycles.
When they were nearer I thought that I recognized
a voice.  And I was right, for one of the
cyclists was my sister.  I struggled up from
the ditch and staggered out on to the road in
dread that they might pass me.  Agna jumped
from her bicycle and let it fall to the ground
as she saw me swaying.  She helped me back
to the ditch.  All I could say to her at first
was, "I'm thirsty, so thirsty."  She peeled an
orange and gave it to me.  I knew that I was
babbling all the time, but neither of us could
remember what I had been saying when we
tried to think of it afterwards.  I did not know
that I had been crying till Agna said, "Don't
cry, Nora.  Here, let me wipe your eyes."  Then
I saw where the tears had splashed down
on my raincoat and felt that my cheeks were
wet.  I suppose I was weeping from sheer
physical exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
"Weren't we lucky to come this road,
Teasie?  This is my sister Nora," said my
sister to the girl who accompanied her.  "We
were going to take the lower road," she said,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
turning to me, "but we were told that although
this was the longer it was the easier for cycling.
And now, I'm glad we took the longer one, for
if we hadn't we would never have met you."
</p>

<p>
"Where were you going?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
She told me.
</p>

<p>
"Why," I cried, "that is the place I have left."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?" said Agna.  "Then we needn't
go.  You can tell us the news.  We wanted
to find out what happened during the raid yesterday."
</p>

<p>
As I sat there on the ditch I told them all
that had happened from the capture of the
three thousand rounds of ammunition to my
own expediences.  When I finished Agna took
the suitcase and balanced it on her bicycle and said:
</p>

<p>
"We may as well go back now."
</p>

<p>
"I'll cycle on in to Ballygawley," said
Teasie, "and find out when there will be a
train this afternoon.  You can come on after me."
</p>

<p>
"How far are we from Ballygawley?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"About two miles," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Agna, when she saw my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
expression at that news.  "We will go so
slowly that you'll never notice it."
</p>

<p>
The three of us went slowly along the road,
Agna and Teasie taking turns at carrying the
suitcase.  At a turn in the road Teasie mounted
her bicycle and rode off.  After we had walked
a long distance I said:
</p>

<p>
"Agna, I can't walk any further.  I'll have
to sit down."
</p>

<p>
I sat for quite a while till Agna said, "Try
again, Nora.  Keep at it as long as you can.
When we get to Ballygawley you'll not have
any more walking to do."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a while," I answered.
</p>

<p>
While we were sitting Teasie returned.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be in plenty of time," she said.
</p>

<p>
I stood up and we started off again.  When
we arrived at the outskirts of Ballygawley
Teasie said, "I called in at a house I knew,
and they are making tea for us.  You'll be
refreshed after it."
</p>

<p>
It was into a shop we went and in a room
back of it a table was laid, and tea was ready
for us.  I drank the tea thirstily but was too
tired to eat, although various things were
pressed on me.  When tea was over Teasie
said to Agna:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
</p>

<p>
"We'll go on our bicycles and meet Nora at
the station of Augher.  That," she said,
turning to me, "is the station before Clogher.  I
think it would be better to get off there than
in the station at Clogher.  Every one would
see you and they would be making all the
guesses in the world as to who you are.  The
police would see you, too, as you would have
to go past the police station.  If you get off
at Augher you can cross the fields to our place
without any one seeing you.  That's all right, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.
</p>

<br>

</p>

<p>
They rode away.  A young lad took my
suitcase to the station for me and waited till
the train came.  The train was only the size
of a trolley but had the dignified title of the
Clogher Valley Railway.  I sat in the corner
and closed my eyes.  I opened them at every
stop to see if there was any sight of the girls.
But it was not till the conductor called out,
"Next stop Augher," that I had any glimpse
of them.  Over the hedge that divided the rails
from the road I saw Agna's black curly head
bobbing up and down and caught a smile from
under Teasie's big-brimmed hat.  They were
peddling for all they were worth in an attempt
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
not to be too far behind the train in arriving at Augher.
</p>

<p>
I waited at the station for about ten minutes
before they came.  They jumped off their
bicycles; and we commenced to walk along the
side of the rails.  About fifteen minutes after
we crossed over into a field.  It was a stiff
piece of work for the girls to push their bicycles
through the fields and lift them over hedges.
When we had gone through four fields we
commenced to climb a hill.  Near the top of
the hill we clambered over another hedge and
crossed one more field before we arrived at
the farm which was Teasie's home.  Teasie's
father and mother had made it a home for
Agna since she arrived at the town; and to
me they also extended a very kindly welcome.
</p>

<p>
"She has walked all the way from Carrickmore,"
said Teasie to her mother.  "We met
her two miles outside of Ballygawley."
</p>

<p>
"Did you walk all that distance?" asked Mrs. Walsh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered.  "I don't see how it
took me so long to walk it, I'm usually a good walker."
</p>

<p>
"When did you start?" she asked me.
</p>

<p>
"Before eight," I answered.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I think you did very well to walk it in one
day," she returned.  "Agna and Teasie were
going to cycle there and stay over night
because it was such a long ride."
</p>

<p>
"I was told that it wasn't five miles," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Five miles!" cried the mother.  "It's fifteen
if it's one, and a bad road at that.  You'll
want to rest after it.  Take her into a
bedroom, girls, and let her lie down."
</p>

<p>
The girls brought me to a bedroom and gave
me cool water to bathe my face and hands and
feet.  Then they ordered me to go to bed.  But
although I went to bed I did not sleep.
</p>

<p>
I had been lying there for about two hours
when Agna peeped in to see if I was awake.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Nora, what are we going to do?" was her
first question.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to Dublin as soon as we can
and you, of course, are going with me."
</p>

<p>
"I had my mind made up to try and get
there to-morrow when we came back, but I
am glad you are here, for now we can be
together and won't have to worry about one
another."  She was speaking in her usual
breathless fashion.  "I'm afraid we can't go
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
to-night," she said.  "Did you hear that there
is fighting in Ardee?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered.  "I did not hear that;
but if there is, we'll go there.  It's on our way
to Dublin.  The men who are fighting will
probably make their way to Dublin.  If we can
catch up with them we will be safer and more
sure of getting there.  Find out if there is a
train to-night."
</p>

<p>
She went out and returned in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.  "There is no train to-night,
but there is one leaving at five minutes to six
in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said.  "I suppose we'll have to
wait for that."
</p>

<p>
We caught the five minutes to six train in
the morning.  It brought us to a junction
where we took tickets for Dundalk.
</p>

<p>
"You're going to a dangerous place," said
the ticket agent.
</p>

<p>
"We won't mind that," we replied.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Dundalk the station
was full of soldiers and constabulary.  We
hurried along out of the station so as not to
attract attention.  Agna went back and asked
a porter if she could get a train to Dublin.
The porter told her that the only train going
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
there was a military one, and that the line
was in the hands of the military.  "There's no
telling when there will be a train," he said.
</p>

<p>
It was then about one o'clock.  "Come
along," I said to Agna.  "We will look for a
restaurant and decide what we will do while
we are eating." We walked down the street
looking for a restaurant.  At the foot of the
street we saw one, a very small place.  Just at
the restaurant the street curved, and around
the curve we saw that a barricade had been
erected by the police authorities.  Luckily we
did not have to pass it to get to the restaurant.
When we had entered and had given our order
to the proprietress, she said that it would take
some time&mdash;would we mind waiting?  We assured
her that we would not mind waiting and
went into the parlor to talk over our situation.
</p>

<p>
The first decision arrived at was, that as
we did not know the name of the villages and
towns on the road to Dublin and could not hire
a car to take us to any of them, it would be
necessary for us to walk.  Our next decision
was that we would have to abandon our suitcase
as it would be likely to attract attention.
In order to carry out the second I told Agna
that she must go out to buy some brown paper
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
and string.  Also, that while she was doing so
she must find out if we would have to pass
the barricade to get to the Dublin road.  The
reason why I sent Agna on this business, and
did not go myself, was that Agna was so childish
looking that no one would suspect her of
trying to get to Dublin.  Then again I knew
that I could trust her to find any information
necessary to us; she had been a girl scout and
had learned the habit of observation.  Also,
her accent was more strongly Northern than mine.
</p>

<p>
With a parting adjuration from me not to
be too long lest I become anxious, Agna went
out on her errand.  As she reached the door
the proprietress came out of a room and said,
"Are you going out, little girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Agna, "I am going out to get a paper."
</p>

<p>
"Will you do a message for me while you are out?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Agna, "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the town?" asked the woman.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Agna, "I haven't been in it
this long time."  (She had never been in it
before.)
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the woman.  "I had better
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
come to the door and show you the place I
want you to go to."  She did so and gave
Agna a message to the butcher's.  Agna was
glad to do the message because if she were
stopped now and asked where she was going
to, she could give a definite answer.  She left
the door and walked towards the barricade.
The policeman on duty there did not stop her
as she walked through.  The barricade was
formed simply of country carts drawn across
the roadway, leaving room for only one vehicle
to pass through, and it was at this space that
the policeman stood.  As I sat by the window,
I saw the policeman stop and examine cyclists,
automobilists, and all other vehicles that were
passing through.  The barricade was on the
road running from Dublin to Belfast.
</p>

<p>
Within twenty minutes Agna returned.
She came into the parlor and gave me a bundle
of brown paper and string, and then went out
to deliver up her other message.  She came
back quickly and began to tell me the result
of her observations.  The best thing was that
we were on the right side of the barricade and
we should not have to pass it when we started
out.  But her next bit of information was not
so pleasant; it was that according to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
automobile signs there were fifty-six miles to
Dublin.  Still, nothing daunted, we began to
transfer our kits from the suitcase to the brown
paper.  When we had finished we had two
tidy-looking bundles much more convenient to
carry than the suitcase.
</p>

<p>
While we were eating our dinner the question
arose as to what we should do with the
suitcase.  We settled it by asking the
proprietress to take care of it till we came back
from Carlingford.  She was quite willing to
oblige us, she said, as Agna had been so
obliging to her.  I then paid the bill and we left
the restaurant.  I felt rather badly at leaving
the suitcase behind me, as it had accompanied
me for some ten thousand miles of my travels;
it was like abandoning an old friend.

<h3>
XII
</h3>

<p>
It was about two-thirty on Saturday when
we started to walk from Dundalk to Dublin,
and when it began to grow dark we were still
walking.  While we were discussing the problem
of where to spend the night, we came upon
a barricade.  We were in a quandary.  What
were we to do?  We slowed up in our walking
but that was no use; we were bound to
pass it eventually&mdash;or be detained.  We had
not the slightest idea as to what we should do.
We did not know the name of the next village,
so we could not say that we were going
there.  We did not even know the name of the
village we were in!  What should we do?  If
we were stopped and searched&mdash;I had my
revolver and ammunition and Agna wore her
uniform under her coat and skirt&mdash;enough
evidence to have us arrested.  However, we
put on a brave face and stepped forward
bravely towards the barricade.  About six
yards from it we encountered two strong wires
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
which were stretched across the entire width
of the road, one reaching to the chin and the
other to the knees.  To give the impression
that we had passed that way before and that
we knew all about the wires, we ducked our
heads under the high wire and put our legs
over the lower one, then continued our walk to
the barricade.
</p>

<p>
It was in charge of a corporal's guard.  As
we came abreast the soldiers, evidently thinking
that we were country girls doing our Saturday's
marketing, made some remark, in a
broad Belfast accent, about carrying our bundles
for us.  In an accent broader than theirs,
Agna gave them some flippant answer at
which they roared with laughter; and while
they were laughing we passed on.  Further
on we came to the village proper.  Not until
we saw the sign over the Post Office&mdash;"Dunleer
P.O."&mdash;did we know the name of the
village through which we were passing.
</p>

<p>
As we walked it grew darker.  "What will
we do&mdash;where will we spend the night?" I said
to Agna.  "There are no hotels about here,
and if there were we could not go to them
as we would have to register.  If we ask at
the cottages for a night's lodging they may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
become suspicious.  If we walk all night we
may meet military or police patrols, and that
would mean that we would be sent to Armagh
Jail instead of going to Dublin.  What will we do?"
</p>

<p>
"O, pick out a nice field and spend the night
there," said Agna airily.
</p>

<p>
"It looks as if that is just what we'll have
to do," I said ruefully.  "Come on and pick
one before it gets too dark."
</p>

<p>
We heard a dog barking further down the
road&mdash;that was the only sign of life.  We
judged that it was about nine o'clock and
that every one was in bed.  There was a path
that turned to the right off the road which
we took and walked along for about one
hundred yards.  Then we clambered over the
hedge and into the field.  It looked as if we
had chosen a good place for we found ourselves
in a sort of dell covered with grass
and heather.  We searched and found, as we
thought, the softest place.  Everything around
us was so still that we felt compelled to talk
in whispers.  We could feel the darkness
descending on us as Ave sat there, forgetting
our weariness in the novelty of the situation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
</p>

<p>
We had been silent for a long time when
Agna said, "To-morrow will be Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said.  "We'll look queer carrying
bundles through the villages on a Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"So we will," said Agna.  "Look," she said
suddenly.  "Why couldn't we put on everything
we can.  It will make us fatter but it
will make the bundles a respectable size.  And
we'll be warmer to-night," she added.
</p>

<p>
Her last remark decided me.  I had been
growing colder every minute I sat there and
any suggestion to relieve me was welcome.
</p>

<p>
"All right," I said.  "Let's start and put them on."
</p>

<p>
We opened the bundles and were very busy
for some time.  When we had finished there
was twice the amount of clothing on than we
had when we begun.  We looked at each other,
feeling bulky.
</p>

<p>
"I hope my coat will go on me," said Agna
as she began to put it on.  "There now, I've
got everything on me except my towels, and
brush and comb.  Oh, and my putties."
</p>

<p>
"You can put them in your coat pocket," I said.
</p>

<p>
"I've got safety pins, roller bandages, my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
handkerchiefs and my purse in them so there's
no room there."
</p>

<p>
"Put them in your raincoat pocket."  She
did so and stood up to inspect herself.
</p>

<p>
"O Lordy," she exclaimed.  "I'm an imitation
umbrella."  Then she turned her attention to me.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get on?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Like you," I replied.  "Only I've a pair
of stockings left."
</p>

<p>
"Put them on you?" she said.  "What's the
use of getting boots two sizes too big for you,
if you can't wear two pairs of stockings when
you want to?"
</p>

<p>
I had forgotten that I could not get my size
when I was buying my marching boots, and
was compelled to take a pair two sizes too
large.  I put the stockings on.
</p>

<p>
"I never felt so big and heavy in my life
before," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be used to it by morning," she said
consolingly.  "Lie down and go to sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Sleep&mdash;"  I commenced when she interrupted
me to ask, "Nora, do you think there
are any earwigs here?  They might get into
our ears when we are asleep."
</p>

<p>
"Earwigs," I repeated.  "I don't know.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
But there's bound to be other insects and they
would just as easily get into our ears as
earwigs."
</p>

<p>
"What will we do?" she asked anxiously, for
she was tired and wanted to sleep.  I looked
about and saw the towels.
</p>

<p>
"Put them around our heads," I said,
pointing to them.  So we each took a towel and
pinned it around our heads to keep out
wandering insects while we slept.  But we need
not have worried about what might happen to
us while we slept, for we did not sleep that
night.
</p>

<p>
As we lay there we could see the stars come
out one by one, yet we could not sleep.  The
quietness of the place kept us listening
expectantly for we knew not what.  A heavy mist
began to cover the field and wrapped itself
about us till our clothes were dampened
through and through.  For the first time, I
think, we were physically aware of the number
of bones in our bodies, for each one seemed
to be dancing to a tune of its own.  Our teeth
were chattering so that we could not speak.
In an effort to keep ourselves warm we lay
close together with our arms round each other.
But our efforts were of no use; we could not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
sleep nor could we keep ourselves warm.  We
gave the struggle up and huddling close to
the ditch we sat and waited for the dawn.
</p>

<p>
After an infinity of time the dawn came.
Far off at the furthermost edge of the field
we saw a streak of gray.  As we watched it
gradually widening we heard a cock crow in
the distance.  Under the descending light the
fields seemed a glistening sea and our tweed
skirts as if sprinkled with diamonds.  The
birds began to awaken and to chirrup in the
hedges.  For all we could see or hear, the
birds and ourselves were the only stirring,
living beings.
</p>

<p>
We sat on waiting for time to pass.  As we
did not have a watch with us we gauged the
time by the sky.  The distance between us
and Drogheda we knew to be less than eight
miles; and there was a possibility that we might
get a train from Drogheda to some of the
local stations.  But as we were not sure we
decided to recommence our walk, so that we
would be all the earlier on our way to Dublin.
With this thought in our minds we rose stiffly
and plodded down the path to the main road.
We really did not feel tired.  As a matter of
fact, we were anxious to have as many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
adventures and experiences as possible to tell our
father when we reached Dublin.  We pictured
ourselves sitting on his knees, as we had often
done before, telling him everything, watching
for the ever-ready twinkle in his eye, and saw
him give the quick throwback of his head, when
we came to the more laughable parts of our
story.  It was this picture that helped us over
the hard parts of our journey.  As we went
along the road to Drogheda our conversation
consisted mainly of&mdash;"Wait till we tell Papa
this&mdash;" or, "What will Papa say to that&mdash;"
and, "Won't he laugh when we tell him&mdash;," so
we whiled away the time, fixing firmly in our
minds the most amusing parts of our journey.
</p>

<p>
It was not until we were within two miles of
Drogheda that we met with any one on the
road.  The first person we saw was a cyclist,
next we saw a man and woman going to milk
the cows.  And then as we went further along
the road we saw many more people wending
their way to town.  At last, we came to
Drogheda.  It was practically deserted&mdash;a
few milk-carts and a couple of policemen were
all that we met as we proceeded into town.
Then a church bell began to ring.  We followed
the sound and soon had joined a crowd
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
that was hurrying to church.  We were in
time for seven o'clock Mass.
</p>

<p>
After Mass we wandered about a little hoping
to find a place where we could get something
to eat, also to find the road to Dublin.
On account of it being Sunday and so early
in the morning there was no place open.
Although hungry we were not as much annoyed
at the result of our search for food as
contented when we came upon the road to
Dublin.  As we walked on I saw the railway
station.  A thought struck me, perhaps we can
get a train now.  I turned to Agna and said,
"Go up to the station and ask if there will be
a train to Skerries to-day."
</p>

<p>
In about fifteen minutes she returned and
said there would be no trains running but the
military trains.  Then once again we started
on our tramp.
</p>

<p>
Agna complained of hunger, and I was
none the less hungry.  We had not eaten since
one-thirty the day before.  "Would it be any
use, do you think," I asked, turning to Agna,
"to call at some of the cottages and ask them
to make some tea for us?"
</p>

<p>
"It might be worth trying, anyway," she replied.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said.  "I'll wait till it gets a little
later then I'll go to some of the cottages and
ask."
</p>

<p>
It was after nine o'clock when I first ventured
to a cottage.  A woman opened the door
to my knock, she had a bonnet on and was
draping a shawl about her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"We have been walking since early morning,"
I said, "and want to know if you will
make us a cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
"I would," she replied, "only I've barely
time to get to Mass.  I'm sorry, but I can't
miss Mass.  I've to walk to Drogheda."
</p>

<p>
"No," I said.  "It wouldn't do to miss Mass."
</p>

<p>
She came to the gate and bade me a cordial
good-by.  I tried two or three cottages after
that, but from them all I had the same story&mdash;they
were all going to Mass, so we had to go
without our breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Just outside Drogheda we saw a milestone
bearing the legend "Dublin 25 miles."  And
from then on the only excitement of our journey
was to see who would be the first to spy
a milestone.  When we saw a milestone
marked "Dublin 18 miles" we were
exhilarated&mdash;Dublin seemed only a few steps away.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
</p>

<p>
Sunday was, if any thing, warmer than the
preceding day, and our double outfit made us
dreadfully uncomfortable.  I knew that it was
not the heat or the long walk, or the two pairs
of stockings that was responsible for the
burning pain in my feet.  My feet were burning
me as never before.  Agna had great faith in
liniment.  She likes to take it with her when
she goes for a long walk; she says it takes
the pain and stiffness from her muscles.
When we were making our preparations the
night before she had "linimented" herself as
she calls the operation.  I had had no pain or
tiredness, but the soles of my feet were sore,
and Agna, in her unfailing faith in the bottle,
had "linimented" them, overruling whatever
objections I had.  And now, I was suffering
torments&mdash;the liniment was burning its way
into my flesh, made tender by the two pairs of
stockings, heavy boots, and long march.  At
last, I could stand it no longer, so I said to
Agna, "I must get my boots and stockings
off&mdash;I'll have to get some relief or I'll go mad."
</p>

</span>
</p>

<p>
I walked towards the hedge that was dividing
the road from the fields and looked through
the branches.  I saw that the land was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
plowed.  It looked so cool and comforting
that I decided to go in to cool my feet.  We
walked along till we saw a gap in the hedge.
We went through it and found ourselves in a
shady corner of the field.  I lost no time in
pulling off my shoes and stockings, and then
I thrust my feet deep down in the cool, brown
earth.
</p>

<p>
How long we sat there I do not know for
we both dozed off.  Then we heard a distant
dull booming which must have awakened us.
Agna must have wakened at the same time as
myself for she was listening, her head turned
away from me, and her ear cocked in the
direction from which the booming came.  The
booming went on at regular intervals.  At
last, Agna turned to me, her eyes widened and
a thought written on her face that she did not
dare to express in words.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Nora?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
I shook my head.  "It's in Dublin," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"There might be fighting in the Irish Sea,"
she hazarded.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's in Dublin," I insisted.  We were
silent for a while, a great dread growing in
our hearts.  Agna broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Dublin, Nora," she said.  "And we are&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We are eighteen miles away from Dublin," I said.
</p>

<p>
When we had seen the last milestone that
told us that we were eighteen miles away from
Dublin, we thought we were very near; but
now, our thought was how very far away we
were from there.
</p>

<p>
The booming continued.  We could picture
our friends, our comrades, boys and girls
fighting with rifles against those big guns
whose booming could be heard eighteen miles away.
</p>

<p>
"We must not lose a minute.  We must
hurry, hurry, hurry till we get to Dublin," I
said, and saw that unconsciously I had been
putting on my shoes and stockings, and that I
was ready for the march.
</p>

<p>
In the torment of our minds as to what those
big guns might be doing at the moment in
Dublin, the pain, the weariness and the hunger
of our bodies went unnoticed.  We swung
along as best we could, trying to keep to the
beat of a march, and determined to be in
Dublin before dark.  We entered a village.
Usually when we came to a village we walked
at an ordinary pace so as not to attract notice
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
by an appearance of haste.  But this time, in
our impatience to be in Dublin, we threw all
cautiousness to the winds and went as quickly
as we could.  We passed through the village;
but just as the main street ended and the
Dublin road began again, we saw a barricade.
Like the others it was made of country carts,
but unlike them it was guarded by both police
and soldiers.  They seemed to be more
particular at this one for we saw them stop a
cyclist and give his bicycle a most thorough
examination.  They looked under the saddle,
and into the tool-bag; and then they turned
their attention to the rider.  His pockets were
turned out one by one.  I suppose they were
looking to see if he carried a dispatch.
</p>

<p>
After him came two boys who were stopped
as they were walking past.  We were almost
at the barricade by this time and we saw close
beside it a restaurant.  As usual they had left
a space for pedestrians to pass through and
unfortunately for us, the door of the restaurant
was on the other side of the barricade.  It
was, if I might use the phrase, next door to it.
But the boys, who had just been stopped by
the military, unintentionally did us a good
turn, for they began to resist being searched.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
While they were talking indignantly, and
struggling with the soldiers, Agna and I
slipped through into the restaurant.  When
we had asked for something to eat we went
to the window to see what was the outcome
of the struggle.  To our surprise, we saw the
boys laughing and chatting with the soldiers
who were examining their pockets.
</p>

<p>
We did not realize how hungry we were till
we began to eat our dinner.  We finished all
before us for we had not eaten since lunch the
day before; and it was three o'clock then.  The
waitress kept hovering around as if she would
like to speak, but did not know how to begin.
At length she asked us if we were going far.
</p>

<p>
"To Clontarf," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"O," she said disappointedly.  "I thought
you might be coming from Dublin, and would
have some news."
</p>

<p>
"No," I said.  "We haven't any; we left
Drogheda this morning and there was no news
there."
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear how things were going in
Dublin?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," I answered.  "Did you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said.  "I heard they were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
surrendering in Dublin&mdash;that they were beaten.
But I don't believe it," she added quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I," I said.  "They couldn't be
beaten so soon."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I've said all along," she said.
Evidently she was a rebel and was trying to
find out if we were, too.  But before we could
carry on any further conversation we heard
the soldiers call "Halt," and then we saw a
motor car stopping outside the window.
</p>

<p>
The waitress put her head out the window
and began to chaff the occupants of the car.
</p>

<p>
"Are you bringing ammunition to the Sinn
Feiners?" she asked them.
</p>

<p>
"How many Sinn Feiners have you hidden
in the car?"&mdash;and so forth.
</p>

<p>
While she was doing this I said to Agna,
"Come, we'll look out, too, then the soldiers
may think we belong here."  We did so and
also joined in the chaffing while the soldiers
were searching the car.  When they had allowed
the car to go on the waitress said to
them in a very sarcastic tone:
</p>

<p>
"All day at it and you haven't caught a
single Sinn Feiner yet?"  The soldiers looked
up at us and grinned sheepishly; but they did
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
not seem the least disturbed at their failure to
catch one.
</p>

<p>
We turned in from the window, paid our
score, and went out of the restaurant just as
the sergeant in command of the barricade was
stepping in.  My heart gave a great leap.
"Was he coming in to question us?" I asked
myself.  But he made way for us and we went
out into the street.  This time we were on the
right side of the barricade; still there was a
chance of our being stopped.  However, we
looked at the soldiers, nodded and smiled to
them, received nods and smiles in return and
walked down the Dublin Road.
</p>

<p>
Balbriggan was the name of the town we
had just left, some fifteen miles from Dublin.
Now that we were refreshed by the meal,
Dublin seemed no distance away from us, and
we felt sure that we could reach it before dark.
We met more people on this road than we had
met within all the rest of our journey, some
going towards Dublin, some towards Drogheda.
Many a bit of news we heard as it
was called across the road by friends as they
passed.  But there was none that we could
rely upon as each bit contradicted the other.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
Still we began to feel that there was bad news
in store for us.
</p>

<p>
We had gone along the road for about four
miles when I suddenly became lame; the big
muscle in my right leg was powerless.  I kept
on as best I could dragging my right leg after
me.  When I had gone about a mile this way
I grew desperate.  The pain was almost more
than I could bear, and the milestones were
dreadfully far apart.  Then I said to Agna,
"The first car that comes along I'll ask for a lift."
</p>

<p>
The first car that came along was a big
gray touring car occupied by a lady and
gentleman.  I did not ask them for a lift; but the
gentleman looked back at us after he had
passed.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he knows us," said Agna.  "It
might be some of our friends dispatching."
</p>

<p>
"No, he's not," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's stopping," returned Agna.
"Hurry up.  Perhaps he will give us a lift."
</p>

<p>
"I can't hurry," I said.  "I'm going as best I can."
</p>

<p>
"Look," said Agna.  "He's backing up towards us."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
</p>

<p>
She was right.  The big car was backing
up to us.  When it was near the man asked,
</p>

<p>
"Are you going far?"
</p>

<p>
"To Clontarf," answered Agna.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going within six miles of it.  If you
care to get in I'll take you that length."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much," said Agna.  "My
sister is almost done up."
</p>

<p>
"You're from the North, aren't you?" asked
the man when we had taken our seats in the car.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered.  "We left Drogheda
this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you going to in Clontarf?" he
asked after he had driven for some distance.
</p>

<p>
"My mother," I said.  "She came down for
the Easter holidays and has not been able to
get away.  She's probably terrified out of her
senses as she has the two youngest children
with her."
</p>

<p>
"She's probably hungry, too," he said.
"Did you bring her food?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I said.  "But we brought her money."
</p>

<p>
"Food would have been better," he said.
"People who live on the outskirts of Dublin
are in a bad way.  They've always depended
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
on Dublin for their supplies.  They can get
none now.  I've just been to Drogheda for bread."
</p>

<p>
"To Drogheda for bread," I repeated in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "It's no joke to have to go
twenty-five miles for bread.  Weren't you two
girls afraid to come down here?"
</p>

<p>
"We had to come," I said simply.  "Papa
couldn't come so he sent us."
</p>

<p>
All this time we had been spinning along at
a splendid rate.  We were cooled off and
feeling rested.  Suddenly the man slowed up the
machine.  "Hello, what's this?" he said.  We
followed his gaze and saw that the telegraph
wires had been completely cut through; not
one wire was left together.  "Hm," he said.
"We must make a note of that and keep our
eyes open for more."  There was no more
conversation after that for some time.  On our
way we saw the wires cut in two places.
</p>

<p>
After some time we came to a village.
There was a guard of soldiers patrolling the
street in front of a building.  When we came
nearer we saw that it was the police barracks;
and that the windows were broken and the
street strewn with telegraph wires.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
</p>

<p>
"O?" I said, wondering what it could mean.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the man.  "The rebels came
here, captured the police barracks, took every
rifle and all the ammunition, and marched
away to Dublin or Wexford.  But before
they did that they cut down all the telegraph
wires and stopped all communication between
this town and any other.  They made a good
job of it&mdash;every man of them got away."
</p>

<p>
He then left the car to go over to speak to
the soldier in charge.  When he returned he
said, "I told him about the wires being cut
further up the road."  And then we started off
again.  He stopped the car outside of the
village near a bridge and told us that he was not
going any further.  We stepped out of the
car and thanked him for his kindness in
bringing us so far.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," he said.  "Don't mention it.
Glad to help any one."
</p>

<p>
We watched him as he turned the car up a
driveway of an estate near the bridge;
wondering if he would be glad to think that he
had helped the daughters of the Commandant-General
of the Rebels to reach Dublin.

<p>
We had been walking only half an hour
when we saw a cavalry regiment coming towards
us and leaving Dublin.  First came the
advance guard, then a long line of soldiers and
horses, and then their artillery and their supply
wagons, and more soldiers brought up the
rear.  They made a brave show tearing along
the country road raising a dust as high as the
horses.
</p>

<p>
"Nora, Nora," wailed Agna.  "They're
leaving Dublin&mdash;they're leaving it&mdash;not going
to it.  Our men must be beaten."
</p>

<p>
"Hush," I said to her.  "They may be going
to some place else."
</p>

<p>
I stopped an old man and asked him,
"Where are they going?  I thought the
fighting was in Dublin."
</p>

<p>
"They're going to Wexford," he replied.
"The rebels have captured two or three towns
and are holding them.  These fellows," pointing
with his thumb over his shoulder at the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
soldiers, "are going down to try and drive
them out.  God curse them," he added,
spitting towards the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"There now," I said as I turned to Agna.
"Isn't that good news?  Wexford out and the
West awake!  East and West the men are
fighting for Ireland.  For Ireland, Agna!
O, aren't you glad to be alive!  We used to
read about the men who fought for Ireland
and dream about them, and now, in a couple
of hours we'll be amongst the men and women
who are fighting in Dublin.  We'll be able to
do something for Ireland."
</p>

<p>
That thought cheered us so and spurred us
on that we arrived in Drumcondra, a suburb
of Dublin, at seven o'clock on Sunday night.

<p>
We were going to the house of a friend in
Clonliffe Road.  On our way there we were
astonished at the ordinary aspect of the streets.
Save for the fact that we saw no soldiers, we
could have thought that there had been no
fighting at all.  Dublin is the most heavily
garrisoned city in Europe.  Ordinarily one
could not walk the streets without seeing scores
upon scores of soldiers.  Therefore, our not
seeing them was a sure sign that things were
not in Dublin as they had been.  When we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
reached the house of our friend, the two
daughters, Kathleen and Margaret, were at the door.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" said Margaret, when she spied us.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you come from?" asked
Kathleen, looking at our travel-worn figures.
Our faces were burnt red by the sun and the
heat, and our boots were white with the dust of
the road.
</p>

<p>
"We've come from Tyrone.  We got a train
to Dundalk and walked the rest.  We spent
last night in a field.  What's the news?  How
are things down here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"How are things," she repeated in
amazement.  "Haven't you heard?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," I answered, as I shook my head,
</p>

<p>
"The boys are beaten," she cried.  "They've
all surrendered.  They're all prisoners.  The
city has been burning since Thursday."
</p>

<p>
"All surrendered," I cried aghast.  "Are
you sure?  It doesn't seem possible."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said.  "I'm sure.  They're all
prisoners, every one of them.  The College of
Surgeons was the last to surrender and it
surrendered a little while ago.  Madame was
there," she said, meaning the Countess
Markievicz.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
</p>

<p>
I sat there too stunned to think or talk.  I
knew that there were women and men going
past the window, yet I could not see them.
After a while I managed to ask, "My father?"
</p>

<p>
"He's wounded and was taken a prisoner to
Dublin Castle.  They don't think he'll live.
Though God knows maybe they'll all be
killed."
</p>

<p>
I was roused from a dazed condition by the
sharp crack-crack-crack of a rifle.
</p>

<p>
"What does that mean?" I asked, turning
to Kathleen.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" she exclaimed.  "Are they
starting again?"  But there was no further
reports.
</p>

<p>
"Can I get across the city?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered.  "We are not allowed
out of our own district.  And anyway we must
not be out after seven; martial law has been
declared."
</p>

<p>
"Must not be out after seven," I repeated.
"But it's after seven now, and there are lots
of people out there on the street."
</p>

<p>
"They're at their own doors," she said
indignantly.  "We can stay around our own
doors, I hope.  Though," she added, "if the
soldiers order us to go inside we must obey."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to get to Mamma," I said.
"She'll be in a dreadful state."
</p>

<p>
"Where is she now?" asked Margaret.
</p>

<p>
"At Madame's cottage in Dundrum," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"There's no way of getting there," she said.
"There's neither trains nor trams running now."
</p>

<p>
"We can walk," I said.  "It's only six miles
and we are well used to walking by now."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Kathleen.  "There's no use
talking about it now.  You can't go and that's
all there is to it.  The best thing you can do
is to eat something and then go to bed.  In the
morning we can see what is to be done."
</p>

<p>
I agreed with that as we sorely needed the
rest; but it was a sorry ending to all our hopes
and expectations.  On our way down we had
been buoyed up by the thought that at last we
would be able to do something for Ireland.
Something, anything that would help on the
fight.  That our men would still be fighting
we never doubted.  And now the fighting had
stopped before we came.  We could never sit
on my father's knee and tell the tales of our
adventures.  He was a prisoner, and wounded,
and like to die.  Perhaps we would never see
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
him again; perhaps Mamma would never see
him again.  Were the men really beaten?
Sharp pain-swollen thoughts came thronging
through my head as I lay on my bed listening
to the sharp crack of a rifle where some lone
sniper was still keeping up the fight.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning Kathleen came into our room.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think?" she exclaimed excitedly.
"They're building a barricade at the
top of this street."
</p>

<p>
"They must expect the fighting to be resumed," I said.
</p>

<p>
We dressed hurriedly and went down to the
drawing room.  From the window I saw the
soldiers entering the houses at the top of the
street, and taking furniture from them with
which to build a barricade.  It stretched clear
across the street, leaving a space open on the
left side.  At that space a guard of soldiers
were stationed.  Kathleen went down to the
barricade to ask for permits which would allow
us to pass it and through the city.  She was
refused the permits.  But we were not
discouraged at the failure of our first attempt.
Kathleen, Agna and I went in another direction
till we met the sentries at the bridge on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
Jones' Road.  Here we were allowed to pass
and after a circuitous route we arrived at the
top of O'Connell Street, near the Parnell
statue.
</p>

<p>
There were evidences of the fighting all
around us.  We saw the buildings falling,
crumbling bit by bit, smoldering and smoking;
a ruin looking like a gigantic cross swayed
and swayed, yet never fell.  I was reminded
of pictures I had seen of the War Zone.  Here
were the same fantastic remains of houses.
Crowds of silent people walked up and down
the street in front of the Post Office.  The
horrible smell of burning filled the air.  And
on one side of the street were dead horses.
</p>

<p>
We saw the General Post Office, the headquarters
of the rebels, still standing, although
entirely gutted by fire.  The British gunners
in their attempt to destroy the Post Office had
destroyed every building between it and the
river.  All around were buildings levelled, or
falling&mdash;but the General Post Office stood
erect.  It was symbolical of the Spirit of
Ireland.  Though all around lies death and
destruction, though wasted by fire and sword,
that very thing which England had put forth
her might to crush, stands erect and provides
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
a rallying place for those who follow after.
English guns will never destroy the Spirit of
Ireland, or the demand for Irish freedom.
</p>

<p>
We were not stopped by any of the soldiers
as we went through the city.  It was not until
we reached Portobello Bridge that we were
told to go back.  We had quite a discussion
with the soldiers.  They said they were under
orders not to allow man or woman, boy or girl,
to pass without permission from their officer.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your officer to be found?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"He is over there at the public house," said
the soldier.
</p>

<p>
We went over to the public house and found
the officer.  He was watching his men who
were taking supplies from the storehouse.
They were probably commandeering.  As
Kathleen spoke with a strong Dublin accent
we made her our spokeswoman.  She told the
officer that our mother lived in Dundrum, and
that we had not been able to get to her since
Easter Monday, and that she was sure her
mother would be crazy thinking that
something had happened to us.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-170"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-170.jpg" alt="PATRICK H. PEARSE">
<br>
PATRICK H. PEARSE
</p>

<p>
The officer looked at us for a few seconds
without saying anything, then said, "I'm sure
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
she would; such a fine lot of girls.  Well, you
can go through."
</p>

<p>
"Where's the pass?" asked Kathleen.
</p>

<p>
"You won't need one," he said.  "Just tell
the sentry to look over my way."
</p>

<p>
We went back to the bridge again.  This
time when we were stopped Kathleen told the
soldier to look over at his officer.  The soldier
looked over, the officer nodded to him, and we
passed through.
</p>

<p>
While we were far out on the Rathmines
Road I saw a poster of the Daily Sketch, an
English illustrated daily.  The poster had a
photo of my father on it with the inscription,
"James Connolly&mdash;The dead rebel leader."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" I cried.  "That my mother
is so far out of the city.  She'll not see that."
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Dundrum late in the afternoon.
We had stopped on our way at shops
to buy some provisions for my mother in case
she were in need of them.  When I came to the
cottage the half-door was open, and through it
came a sound of weeping, and the frightened
crying of my youngest sister.  I pulled
back the bolt of the half-door and stepped into
the cottage.  My mother was sitting on a chair
weeping.  I saw that somehow she had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
received a copy of the Daily Sketch bearing the
false news of my father's death.  But she did
not know it was false and was mourning my
father.  When I entered she looked up in
amaze, caught her breath, and then run
towards me crying,
</p>

<p>
"My girl, my girl.  I thought you were lost
to me too."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't lost any one yet, Mamma," I
said.  "Papa is wounded and a prisoner, but
that is all.  They don't shoot or hang prisoners
of war.  Agna is coming up the path.  She'll
be here in a minute.  Be our own brave little
mother again."
</p>

<p>
Just then Agna came and mother's grief was
somewhat alleviated.  With her arms around
the two of us she said:
</p>

<p>
"I'd given up all hope of ever seeing you
again.  Now, I have you and know that your
father is not dead.  But they'll not let him live
long," she cried.  "They fear him.  They know
they can neither bribe nor humble him.  He'll
always fight them.  I've lost Rory too.  I don't
know what happened to him.  He went with
his father on Monday.  That was the last I
saw of him."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
</p>

<p>
Rory is my fifteen-year-old brother, the only son.
</p>

<p>
"Rory's probably in Jail with the rest of the
boys," I said.  "They were all imprisoned when
they surrendered.  He'll be all right there.
He's in good company."
</p>

<p>
We talked long into the morning.  Hoping
against hope, comforting each other, praying
for courage, yet always despairing, we spent
the night.  The night was long though we tried
to make ourselves as comfortable as the
cramped quarters and our uneasy minds would
allow.
</p>

<p>
I left the cottage early in the morning to go
to Dublin to find a place where my mother
and the family could stay.  We wanted to be
near at hand in case there would be a chance
to see my father.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
On Wednesday my mother and sisters came
in to Dublin.  Agna went up to Dublin Castle
to try to see my father.  She made a number
of attempts to see him, received all sorts of
advice, was sent chasing from pillar to post;
and finally was told that no visitors would be
allowed.  The only news she was able to get
was from a nurse who told her that Papa was
very weak from loss of blood; and that he was
not improving.
</p>

<p>
After that all the news we had of my father
was through the newspapers.  They told us
that he was steadily growing weaker and that
his recovery was doubtful.  Then we had heard
of the murder of Sheehy Skeffington.  Agna
had met Mrs. Skeffington when she was at
Dublin Castle, and had been told the awful
news of Skeffington's death.  It was a
dreadful shock.  We had known and admired
Sheehy Skeffington, and he had been a great
friend of Papa's.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
</p>

<p>
Then day by day the news of executions
nearly drove us out of our minds.  We heard
of the executions of Tom Clarke, and of
Padraic Pearse, and of Thomas MacDonagh.
Every time we heard the newsboys call out,
"Two more executions," or "One more execution"
we dreaded to look in the paper for fear
we might read my father's name.  And yet
we must buy the papers.
</p>

<p>
Every day we heard of further arrests.
Every day we saw men being marched off
between rows of soldiers.  And Mamma had had
the added fear of my being arrested given
to her.  Some one had come to the house and
told her that the police were searching for me.
I felt that it was not so but could not convince
Mamma.  At times the awful terror that we
were all going to be taken from her took
possession of her, and she could not be comforted.
We had found out that Rory was imprisoned
in Richmond Barracks.  Mamma feared and
dreaded that he might be shot because of his
relationship to his father.
</p>

<p>
"Willie Pearse was executed because he was
Padraic Pearse's brother," she would say when
we remonstrated with her.  "He was not a
leader; he was only a soldier.  Rory was a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
soldier too.  How can I be sure that he won't
be shot?"
</p>

<p>
On Sunday afternoon we found a note in the
letter box addressed to Mrs. Connolly.  Mamma
opened it and read: "If Mrs. Connolly will
call at Dublin Castle Hospital on Monday or
Tuesday after eleven o'clock she can see her
husband."  Mamma was in terror that Papa's
time had come.  Every one had been telling her
that the fact of Papa's being wounded was a
good thing for him; that as long as he was
wounded he would not be executed; and that
by the time he was well public feeling would
have grown so strong the authorities would
hesitate to shoot him.  "They'll never execute
a wounded man" was the cry.
</p>

<p>
I quieted Mamma's terror somewhat by pointing
out that the note said Monday or Tuesday,
so the day of his execution could not be either
of those days.  Still she was in an agony of
impatience for Monday morning.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to tell him that Rory is in
Richmond Barracks," she said.
</p>

<p>
She had just said this when a knock came
to the door.  When we opened it Rory and a
chum of his stepped inside of the door.  They
were filthy dirty and their eyes were red
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
rimmed.  Sleep clogged their eyes and made
speech difficult to them.
</p>

<p>
"Rory," cried my mother.  "And Eamonn&mdash;where
were you?"
</p>

<p>
"We were both in Richmond Barracks,"
said Rory.  "We're hungry," he added.
</p>

<p>
While we got them something to eat they
had a wash and came to the table more like
themselves.
</p>

<p>
"We haven't had a real sleep since Easter,"
said Rory as an excuse for his prodigious
yawns.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you sleep in Richmond Barracks?"
asked my sister Moira.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep," he cried.  "The room we were in
had marked on the door "Accommodation for
eleven men" and they put eighty-three of us
into it.  There was hardly room to stand.  We
couldn't sit down, we couldn't lie down, we
couldn't wash, we couldn't do anything there,"
he broke off.
</p>

<p>
We asked him if he knew many of the men
in the room with him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said.  "Tom Clarke was in the room
with me, and Sean MacDermott, and Major
MacBride.  But they were removed later."
</p>

<p>
"How did they come to let you out?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
</p>

<p>
"O, they were releasing all boys under sixteen."
</p>

<p>
"Did they ask you anything about your
father?" asked Mamma.
</p>

<p>
"O," said Rory, "I didn't give them my right
name.  I'm down as Robert Carney, of Bangor,
Co. Down."
</p>

<p>
On Monday morning Mamma went to see
my father.  Before she went I said, "If you get
the chance tell him that we are safe."
</p>

<p>
"O, I'd be afraid to mention your name,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said.  "Tell him that Gwendolyn
Violet has turned out to be a great walker;
that she walked to Dublin.  That will satisfy
him and quiet his mind."
</p>

<p>
Gwendolyn Violet was a name bestowed on
me by my father when once I had tried to ride
my high-horse.  And he often used it when he
did not desire to refer to me by name.
</p>

<p>
Before Mamma was allowed to see Papa she
was subjected to a most rigorous search.  She
was also required to give her word that she
would not tell him of anything that had gone
on outside since the rebellion.  Also to promise
that she would not bring in anything for him
to take his life with.  My youngest sister, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
was not quite eight years old, and whom Mamma
had brought with her was also searched.
Mamma came home in a more contented frame
of mind.  She was sure that he would be spared
to her for some time.
</p>

<p>
On Tuesday I went with Mamma to see my
father.  There were soldiers on guard at the
top of the stairs and in the small alcove
leading to Papa's room.  They were fully armed
and as they stood guard they had their bayonets
fixed.  All that armed force for a wounded
man who could not raise his shoulders from the
bed!
</p>

<p>
In Papa's room there was an officer of the
R.A.M.C. all the time with him.  Papa had
been wounded in the leg, both bones had been
fractured.  When I saw him his wounded leg
was resting in a cage.  He was very weak and
pale and his voice was very low.  I asked him
was he suffering much pain.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  "But I have been
courtmartialed to-day.  They propped me up in
bed.  The strain was very great."
</p>

<p>
I was very much depressed.  I had been
thinking that there would be no attempt to
shoot him till he was well.  But then&mdash;I knew,
that if they courtmartialed him while he was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
unable to sit up in his bed, they would not
hesitate to shoot while he was wounded.  I asked
him how he got wounded.
</p>

<p>
"It was while I had gone out to place some
men at a certain point.  On my way back I
was shot above the ankle by a sniper.  Both
bones in my leg are shattered.  I was too far
away from the men whom I had just placed
to see me, and I was too far from the Post
Office to be seen.  So I had to crawl back till
I was seen.  The loss of blood was great.  They
couldn't get it staunched."
</p>

<p>
He was very cheerful as he lay in his bed
making plans for our future.  I know now that
he knew what his fate was to be.  But he never
gave us word or sign that his sentence had been
pronounced an hour before we were admitted
to him.  He gave my mother a message to
Sheehy Skeffington asking him to get some of
his (Papa's) songs published and to give the
proceeds to my mother.  It nearly broke my
mother's heart to think that she could not tell
him that his good friend and comrade had
already been murdered by the British.  I tried
to tell him some things.  I told him that the
papers had it that Captain Mellowes was still
out with his men in the Galway hills.  I told
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
him that Laurence Ginnell was fighting for
the men in the House of Commons.
</p>

<p>
"Good man, Larry," he said.  "He can always
be depended upon."
</p>

<p>
He was very proud of his men.
</p>

<p>
"It was a good, clean fight," he said.
"The cause cannot die now.  The fight will put
an end to recruiting.  Irishmen now realize the
absurdity of fighting for the freedom of another
country while their own is still enslaved."
</p>

<p>
He praised the brave women and girls who
had helped in the fight.
</p>

<p>
"No one can ever say enough to honor or
praise them," he said.  I mentioned the number
of young boys who had been in the fight.
</p>

<p>
"Rory, you know, was only released on Sunday
last along with the other boys of sixteen
or under."
</p>

<p>
"So Rory was in prison," said my father.
"How long?"
</p>

<p>
"Eight days," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"He fought for his country, and has been
imprisoned for his country, and he's not sixteen.
He has had a great start in life.  Hasn't
he, Nora?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," he said.  "What happened when
you arrived in the North?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
</p>

<p>
"The men were all dispersed and could not
be brought together again," I answered.
"When I saw that there would be no fighting
there, I tried to come back here.  I came by
road," I added.
</p>

<p>
"Did you walk the whole way?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only from Dundalk," I said.  "And when
I arrived the fighting was over.  I had no
chance&mdash;I did nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said my father as he reached up
his arms and drew me down to his breast.  "I
think my little woman did as much as any of us."
</p>

<p>
"There was one young boy, Lillie," he said,
turning to my mother, "who was carrying the
top of my stretcher when we were leaving the
burning Post Office.  The street was being
swept continually with bullets from machine
guns.  This young lad was at the head of the
stretcher, and if a bullet came near me, he
would move his body in such a way that he
might receive the bullet instead of me.  He
was so young looking, although big, that I
asked him his age.  'I'm just fourteen, sir,' he
answered."
</p>

</p>

<p>
My father's eyes lit up as he was telling the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
story and at the end he said, "We cannot fail
now.  Those young lads will never forget."
</p>

<p>
When next I saw my father it was on Thursday,
May 11, at midnight.  A motor ambulance
came to the door.  The officer who
accompanied it said my father was very weak
and wished to see his wife and eldest daughter.
Mamma believed this story because she had
seen my father on Wednesday and he was in
great pain and very weak then.  He told her
also that he never slept without receiving
morphine.  Nevertheless she was a trifle apprehensive
for she asked the officer to tell her if they
were going to shoot my father.  The officer
said he could tell her nothing.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to take hours to get to the Castle.
We went through the dark, deserted, burning
streets encountering only the sentries.  We
could hardly restrain ourselves while the
sentries were questioning the driver.  The minutes
seemed hours.  At last, we arrived at the
Castle and were taken to Papa's room.  As we
went up the stairs we were surprised to see that
about a dozen soldiers were encamped on the
small landing outside his room.  They had
their mattresses and their full equipment with
them.  Six soldiers were asleep, six more on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
guard at the top of the stair with rifles and
fixed bayonets.  And in the alcove leading to
the room were three more also with fixed
bayonets.  There was an officer on guard in the
room.
</p>

<p>
When we entered the room Papa had his
head turned to the door watching for our coming.
When he saw Mamma he said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lillie, I suppose you know what this means?"
</p>

<p>
"O James!  It's not that&mdash;it's not that?" my
mother wailed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Lillie," he said.  "I fell asleep for the
first time to-night and they wakened me at
eleven and told me that I was to die at dawn."
</p>

<p>
My mother broke down, laid her head on his
bed and sobbed heartbreakingly.
</p>

<p>
My father patted her head and said, "Don't
cry, Lillie, you'll unman me."
</p>

<p>
"But your beautiful life, James," my mother
sobbed.  "Your beautiful life."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lillie," he said.  "Hasn't it been a
full life, and isn't this a good end?"  My
mother still wept.
</p>

<p>
I was crying too.  He turned to me at the
other side of the bed and said:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry, Nora, there is nothing to cry about."
</p>

<p>
I said, "I won't cry."  He patted my hand
and said, "That's my brave girl."  He then
whispered to me, "Put your hand here,"
making a movement under the clothes.  I put my
hand where he indicated.  "Put it under the
clothes," he said.  I did so and he slipped
something stiff into my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Smuggle that out," he said.  "It is my last
statement."
</p>

<p>
Mother was sitting at the other side of the
bed holding Papa's hand, her face growing
grayer and older every minute.
</p>

<p>
"Remember, Lillie," said my father.  "I
want you and the girls to go to America.  It
will be the best place for the girls to get on.
Leave the boy at home in Ireland.  He was a
little brick and I am proud of him."
</p>

<p>
My mother could only nod her head.  Papa
tried to cheer her up by telling her about a
man who came to the Post Office, during the
revolution, to buy a penny stamp; and how
indignant he was when he was told he could
not get one.  "Don't know what Dublin is
coming to when you can't buy a stamp at the
Post Office," he said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
</p>

<p>
Papa then turned to me and said, "I heard
that poor Skeffington was killed."  I said,
"Yes."  And then I told him that all his staff,
that all the best men in Ireland were gone.  He
was silent for a while, then said, "I am glad I
am going with them."  I think he thought he
was the first to be executed.  I told him that
the papers that day had said, that it was
promised in the House of Commons that there
would be no more shootings.  "England's
promises," was all he said to that.
</p>

<p>
The officer then told us that we had only
five minutes more.  My mother was nearly
overcome; we had to give her water.  Papa
tried to clasp her in his arms but he could only
lift his head and shoulders from the bed.  The
officer said, "Time is up."  Papa turned to
say "Good-by" to me.  I could not speak.
"Go to mother," he said.
</p>

<p>
I tried to bring her away.  I could not move
her.  She stood as if turned to stone.  A nurse
came forward and helped her away.  I ran
back and kissed my father again.  "Nora, I'm
proud of you," said my father.  I kissed him
again, then the door was shut and we saw him
no more.
</p>

<p>
We were brought back to the house.  Mother
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
went to the window, pulled back the curtain,
and stood watching for the dawn, moaning all
the while.  I thought her heart would break
and that she would die too.
</p>

<p>
When dawn was past and we knew that my
father was dead, I opened the stiff piece of
paper he had given me, and read to my mother,
my brother and sisters the Last Statement of
my father.
</p>

<p>
This is what I read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
To the Field General Court Martial, held at Dublin
Castle, on May 9, 1916.
</p>

<p>
The evidence mainly went to establish the fact that the
accused, James Connolly, was in command at the General
Post Office, and was also the Commandant-General of
the Dublin Division.  Two of the witnesses, however,
strove to bring in alleged instances of wantonly risking
the lives of prisoners.  The Court held that these charges
were irrelevant and could not be placed against the
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
I do not wish to make any defense except against
charges of wanton cruelty to prisoners.  These trifling
allegations, that have been made, if they record facts
that really happened, deal only with the almost unavoidable
incidents of a hurried uprising against long established
authority, and nowhere show evidence of set purpose
to wantonly injure unarmed persons.
</p>

<p>
We went out to break the connection between this country
and the British Empire, and to establish an Irish
Republic.  We believed that the call we then issued to the
people of Ireland, was a nobler call, in a holier cause,
than any call issued to them during this war, having any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
connection with the war.  We succeeded in proving that
Irishmen are ready to die endeavoring to win for Ireland
those national rights, which the British Government has
been asking them to die to win for Belgium.  As long as
that remains the case the cause of Irish Freedom is safe.
</p>

<p>
Believing that the British Government has no right
in Ireland, never had any right in Ireland, and never can
have any right in Ireland, the presence, in any one
generation of Irishmen, of even a respectable minority, ready
to die to affirm that truth, makes that government forever
a usurpation and a crime against human progress.
</p>

<p>
I personally thank God that I have lived to see the day
when thousands of Irishmen and boys, and hundreds of
Irish women and girls were ready to affirm that truth, and
to attest it with their lives if need be.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  (Signed) JAMES CONNOLLY, Commandant-General,<br>

<p>
We went to Dublin Castle that morning to
ask for his body.  It was refused to us.  The
authorities were not permitting even a coffin,
we were told.  But a kind nurse had cut off a
lock of Papa's hair and this she gave to Mamma.
</p>

<p>
That was all there was left of him for us.
</p>

<p>
We saw Father Aloyisus who had attended
my father to Kilmainham jail where he had
been shot.
</p>

<p>
"How did they shoot him&mdash;how could they
shoot him?  He couldn't sit up in his bed.  He
couldn't stand up to be shot," I cried.  "How
was he shot?"
</p>

<p>
"It was a terrible shock to me," said Father
Aloyisus.  "I had been with him that evening
and I promised to come to him this afternoon.
I felt sure there would be no more executions&mdash;at
least that is how I read the words of
Mr. Asquith.  And your father was so much easier
than he had been.  I was sure that he would
get his first night's real rest."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
</p>

<p>
"But, how did they shoot him, Father?"
</p>

<p>
"The ambulance that brought you home
from him came for me.  I was astonished.  I
had felt so sure that I would not be needed
that for the first time since the rising I locked
the doors.  And some time after two, I was
knocked up.  The ambulance brought me to
your father.  He was a wonderful man.  I am
sorry to say that of all men who have been
executed, he was the only one I did not know
personally.  Though I knew of him and admired
his work.  I will always thank God as
long as I live that He permitted me to be with
your father till he was dead.  Such a wonderful
man he was.  Such concentration of mind."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Father, but they shot him&mdash;how?"
</p>

<p>
"They carried him from his bed in an ambulance
stretcher down to a waiting ambulance
and drove him to Kilmainham Jail.  They
carried him from the ambulance to the Jail yard
and put him on a chair....  He was very
brave and cool....  I said to him, 'Will you
pray for the men who are about to shoot you,'
and he said, 'I will say a prayer for all brave
men who do their duty.' ... His prayer was,
'Forgive them for they know not what they do.'
... And then they shot him...."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
</p>

<p>
"What did they do with him, then?" whispered
my mother.
</p>

<p>
"They took the body to Arbor Hill Barracks.
All the men who were executed are there."
</p>

<p>
Papa had told mother to ask for his personal
effects.  And mother had asked for them.  We
only received some of his underclothes and the
night clothes he wore in bed while he was
wounded.  Papa had said that the authorities
had his watch, his pocketbook, and his uniform.
But the officer in charge knew nothing about
them.
</p>

<p>
Mother made many inquiries.  But it was
not until she went in person to General Maxwell
that she succeeded in having the pocket
book returned to her.  Major Price, Chief
Intelligence Officer in Ireland, had told her
that they were keeping it for evidence.
</p>

<p>
Evidence&mdash;what more evidence did they
require against a man they had executed?
</p>

<p>
Some time afterwards we recovered his
watch; but we never found his uniform.  And
since I came to America I have been shown
that a copy of the paper my father edited with
his last corrections upon it, was put upon the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
market by a careful British officer who had
figured out its value as a souvenir.
</p>

<p>
And then the whispered warnings came
again to awaken my mother's fear.  Some
messages reached her that the police were again
looking for me.  Nor could I convince her
otherwise.  She begged and pleaded with me
to go away from Dublin so that I would not
be arrested.  So that she might feel more at
ease in her mind, I went to Belfast.
</p>

<p>
Even then she did not feel that I was safe.
She came to Belfast and asked me to try to
get to America alone.  In accordance with my
father's last wish she had applied for passports
to take us all to America, or to take the girls.
But the British authorities felt that the arrival
of Mrs. Connolly and her five daughters in
America would be prejudicial to the interests
of the Realm; and refused her the passports.
She had gone again and again to the authorities,
only to be sent hither and thither on a
fool's errand.  And as she despaired of ever
getting them she asked me to make any
attempt I could and to use whatever means I
could to get to America.
</p>

<p>
"Let them see that your comings and goings
are not dependent on their goodwill."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
</p>

<p>
And I to please her left Ireland and crossed
to England.  There I applied for a passport;
and was given one.  Not as the daughter of
James Connolly, however.
</p>

<p>
It was the last week of June that we received
the final refusal of our request for passports,
and on the third week of July I sailed
from Liverpool.  I arrived in New York the
first day of August, nineteen hundred and sixteen.

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
For the benefit of the reader in whose mind
there might rise some confusion with regard
to the demobilization of the Irish Volunteers,
and how this demobilization order could spoil
the plans for the Rising, and why Eoin MacNeill
had the power to send out such an order,
I am adding the following statement:
</p>

<p>
When the Irish Volunteers were first organized,
it was necessary to have a man known
throughout Ireland, a man of some reputation
and authority, as the head of the organization.
Eoin MacNeill was such a man.  He was an
authority on Irish History and Ancient
Ireland.  Also, what was more necessary, he was
an unknown quantity to the English Government.
Had there been elected as President a
man well known as a revolutionary and as an
Extremist, there would have been short work
made of the Irish Volunteers.  The English
Government would then have known immediately
that the Irish Volunteers were being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
organized, drilled, and supplied with arms for
the sole purpose of a rebellion against it, and
would have given it no opportunity to spread
and grow, and become disciplined.  As it was,
with MacNeill as the President, whom they
knew as a rather conservative, academic person,
whose politics at that time were more of
the Home Rule order than anything else, they
felt quite at ease and contented about the
growth of the Irish Volunteers.
</p>

<p>
MacNeill, although friendly with, and because
of the Irish Volunteers in continual contact
with, the revolutionary members, was not
a member of the Revolutionary Organization.
He was not of the type to which revolutionists
belong.  His mind was of the academic order
which must weigh all things, consider well all
actions, and count the cost.  A true revolutionist
must never count the cost, for he knows
that a revolution always repays itself, though
it cost blood, and through it life be lost and
sacrifice made.  He knows that the flame of
the ideal which caused the revolution burns all
the more brightly, and steadily, and thus
attracts more men and minds, and because of the
life-blood and sacrifice becomes more enduring.
</p>

<p>
That a man of MacNeill's type of mind
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
should have gone so far along the road to
revolution is the extraordinary thing.  Due
credit should be given to him for that, although
he did fail his comrades at the critical moment.
</p>

<p>
MacNeill was made President, and all
orders affecting the organization as a whole,
that is all important orders, came from him
under his signature.  Therefore, when an order
came with his signature, the Irish Volunteers
obeyed it unquestioningly.
</p>

<p>
Padraic Pearse as Commandant-General of
the Irish Volunteers was Chief in military
affairs.  And that is where the Irish Volunteers
made the first mistake.  The office of President
should have been of a purely civil character.
So that when a military order was issued from
Headquarters, it would bear, not the signature
of the President but the signature of the Military
chief.  That this would have been difficult,
I am aware,&mdash;it is so easy to see mistakes after
they are made.
</p>

<p>
MacNeill, through the columns of the <i>Irish
Volunteer</i> (the official organ of the Irish
Volunteers), always preached prudence, and a
waiting policy.  He advised the Volunteers not
to be the first to attack, but to wait to be
attacked.  He counseled them to recruit their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
ranks, so that when the war was ended their
number would reach three hundred thousand;
and that an armed force of three hundred
thousand men would then be in a position to
demand the freedom of Ireland from England.
Still, as before, this counsel was regarded by
the rank and file of the Irish Volunteers as a
necessary evil, knowing that it is not wise
policy to show your hand to the enemy before
the appointed time.
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary members, all this time,
were completing their plans, strengthening the
organization, and waiting eagerly and hopefully
for the days to pass, and the Day of all
days to come.  Every time they thought of the
approaching day they were quietly exultant.
They knew that their chance of success was
greater than it had ever been since the days
of Shane and Hugh O'Neill.  And they joyfully,
and prayerfully thanked God that the
opportunity had come in their day.  All things
went well, their plans matured, and at last they
were ready for the fight.
</p>

<p>
The order for mobilizing was sent through
the length and breadth of Ireland, and it was
signed by Eoin MacNeill.  The order was
received and obeyed by the Irish Volunteers.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
Then, on Good Friday, came the news that
Roger Casement was arrested.
</p>

<p>
Roger Casement had gone to Germany,
shortly after the outbreak of the war, to seek
an expression of goodwill toward Ireland from
Germany.  Germany knew that Ireland was
held in subjection to England, contrary to the
wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people,
and that Ireland had always considered the
enemy of her oppressor as her friend.  Germany
knew that when Spain was England's
enemy, Ireland had sought the assistance of
the Spanish King, and when France was the
enemy of England, Wolfe Tone and Robert
Emmet had both sought the aid of France; she
knew that when England was at war with the
Boers, Irishmen had organized a brigade, and
gone to South Africa, in the hope of helping
to defeat the English enemy.  She knew, that
then, as now, Ireland was anti-British, and
would remain so.  Therefore, Germany declared
her goodwill towards Ireland, and to
the present day Ireland has been free from
the terrors of Zeppelin raids, and there has
been no German bombardment of our coast.
</p>

<p>
Soon after arriving in Germany, Roger
Casement lost touch with Irish affairs.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
still believed that the Irish Volunteers were as
badly armed as when he left Ireland.  He did
not know of the plans for the rising, nor did
he know who were to be the leaders, or whether
they had military ability or not.
</p>

<p>
He did not know that the leaders, acting on
the expression of goodwill, had asked Germany
to send them some arms.  I wish to make
it plain that Germany never made an offer to
the men in Ireland, that she gave nothing to
them, not even the expression of goodwill, till
she was asked, and that when a request for aid
came from Ireland, it was not for money
(England has kept us so poor that we have
almost learned to do without money), nor was
it for men, but for arms, guns, and ammunition.
All that Germany promised in return to
the request, was that she would make the
attempt to send us a certain amount of arms,
but as the ship would have to run the gauntlet
of the British fleet, she would promise nothing.
</p>

<p>
This answer was satisfactory to the revolutionary
leaders.  A date was set for the ship
to arrive, and a place designated.
</p>

<p>
After setting the date and sending it on to
Germany, the leaders found that it was necessary
to change the date.  Word was sent to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
Germany, but only arrived there after the
shipload of arms had set out.
</p>

<p>
About this time Roger Casement heard that
a revolution was about to take place.  He
asked that he be sent over to Ireland.  There
was some demur at this, but finally they
consented and gave him a submarine.  With him
on the submarine went two followers of Casement.
</p>

<p>
The shipload of arms arrived on the first
appointed date but the men in Ireland, not
knowing that their final message had been too
late, had no one there to meet it.  Consequently,
the ship had to hang about for a number
of hours, and finally attracted the suspicion of
the fleet which was in Queenstown Harbor.
When challenged by the fleet, knowing that
subterfuge was hopeless, the Captain ran up
the German flag, and sunk the vessel with all
the arms and ammunition.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after this, the submarine with
Casement and the two other men arrived off the
Irish coast.  They were landed with the aid
of a collapsible boat belonging to the
submarine.  Casement, after sending a message to
MacNeill advising against the Rising, and
saying in the message that Germany had failed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
us, sought shelter in an old ruin.  One of the
men managed to make his way into the country
and so escaped.  Casement was arrested.
</p>

<p>
Before he was hanged he said that his whole
object in coming to Ireland was to prevent the
Revolution.  He did not do so, but was,
perhaps, the primary cause of its failure.
</p>

<p>
Acting on Casement's message and believing
it, MacNeill sent out the demobilizing
orders.  He had sent out many of them before
the other leaders became aware of it.  He also
gave instructions to the Secretary of the Irish
Volunteers to send out more.  Then Pearse
and MacDonagh had a conference with him.
After the conference he said to the Secretary
that although the thing was hopeless, he was
afraid it must go on.
</p>

<p>
He knew that the revolutionary leaders had
decided that the revolution must take place,
even though the loss of the arms had seriously
crippled their plans.  He knew that a disarmament
of the Irish Volunteers had been threatened,
also the imprisonment of the leaders.  He
knew that the Volunteers would resist the
disarming, and that the leaders still thought that
they would have a good fighting chance.
</p>

<p>
When he knew that the fight would go on in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
Dublin, in spite of his order, he began to weigh
up the consequences, and saw nothing before
the Irish Volunteers save death and imprisonment.
The responsibility of allowing these
men to go out to meet these, weighed too heavily
on him, and he thought that he might save
the Irish Volunteers in the country from them.
He then had a message inserted in the Sunday
<i>Independent</i>, a paper that went to all the
nooks and corners of the country, to the effect
that:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"All Volunteer maneuvers for Sunday are canceled.
Volunteers everywhere will obey this order.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
(Signed) EOIN MACNEILL.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was not until Sunday morning that the
other leaders knew of this demobilization order
in the paper.
</p>

<p>
The consequences of this order in the paper,
and the orders that were sent out before it, I
have already told.
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<div class='secthead'>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
